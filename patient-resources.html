	  <span class="font-size-l"><strong>Oral Surgery Postoperative Instructions</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>What to Expect After Oral Surgery</strong><br>Some teeth are imbedded or positioned in the jaw in such a way that bone surgery is necessary for their removal. This is especially true of impacted wisdom teeth. The removal of such teeth is quite different from the extraction of erupted teeth. The following conditions may occur, all of which may be considered normal in the first few days after surgery.<br><br>The area operated on will swell. The swelling will reach its peak about 36 hours after surgery.<br><br>Trismus (tightness) of the muscles may cause difficulty in opening the mouth.<br><br>You may have a slight earache and a sore throat may develop.<br><br>Note that you have been given a long-acting local anesthetic. This anesthetic may last as long as 8 to 12 hours. Even if your procedure involved I.V. sedation, you are still given local anesthetic although you may not remember even getting it. Therefore, you will experience numbness for several hours. Numbness around the corner of the mouth or in the lip or tongue on the side from which the tooth was removed may persist. This is called “paresthesia” and is generally a temporary condition which will resolve. It may persist for a few days to several months. In remote instances, it may be permanent. If numbness persists long-term, there may be surgical treatment available.<br><br>If the corners of the mouth are stretched, they may dry out and crack. Your lips should be kept moist with a cream or ointment.<br><br>There will be a cavity or socket where the tooth was removed. This will eventually fill in with tissue. Black and blue or yellow discoloration may occur on the outside of the face near the area of the surgery. This occurrence is not unusual and will disappear within several days.<br><br>There may be a slight elevation in temperature for 24 to 48 hours. If this continues, please notify the office.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Instructions Following Removal of Impacted and Surgically Extracted Teeth</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">1. <strong>PAIN</strong> – Take your pain medicine as directed. Medication instructions must be followed very carefully including not exceeding recommended doses, not combining different medications unless specifically directed, and not driving, operating machinery, or making important decisions while taking medication that can cause drowsiness or impair judgment. Note that elevation of the head (i.e. not lying flat) and use of ice packs as described below will both contribute to relief of pain. Note also that some pain medications may cause dizziness. You should stand up slowly while taking these medications. If you are lying down, sit up first and then stand up slowly to avoid dizziness that could result in a fall. Do not drink any alcohol while taking pain medication.<br><br>2. <strong>SWELLING</strong> – To help minimize ordinary immediate postoperative swelling, apply an ice pack to the face over the operated area (15 minutes on, 15 minutes off, repeat) for the first 36 hours following surgery. After 36 hours, discontinue the ice packs and begin moist heat compresses. It is not unusual to have additional swelling on the second or third day. Do not go to sleep with an ice pack or hot compress in place.<br><br>3. <strong>BLEEDING</strong> – A certain amount of bleeding is to be expected following the operation. Blood tinted saliva may be seen for about 36 hours. If bleeding occurs after you return home, place a small moistened gauze pad (about the size of a tea bag) or a moistened tea bag directly over the socket for at least 30 minutes, holding it in place with firm biting pressure. If your wisdom teeth have been removed, the correct position of the gauze pack will be behind the last tooth in the mouth. It may be necessary to repeat this procedure. If bleeding continues, please call the office. If bleeding is excessive, call the office immediately.<br><br>4. <strong>DO NOT DISTURB THE BLOOD CLOT</strong> – Its grayish or yellowish appearance and slight odor do not indicate an infected condition. Keep fingers, toothpicks, or other matter that may cause infection out of the mouth. Keep your tongue away from the surgical area. Do not smoke, rinse your mouth vigorously or drink through a straw for 48 hours. These activities create suction in the mouth which could dislodge the clot and delay healing. Forceful spitting and excessive physical activity tend to increase and prolong bleeding as does bending over to pick up objects. A semi-reclining position and rest for the first few hours is recommended. Limit strenuous activity for at least 24 hours after the extraction. This will reduce bleeding and help the blood clot to form. Avoid vigorous exercise for the first 3-5 days. Contact sports should be avoided until healing is complete to avoid the possibility of jaw fracture.<br><br>5. <strong>MOUTH RINSING</strong> – Vigorous mouth rinsing may stimulate bleeding by breaking clots which have formed. Therefore, do not rinse the mouth for 24 hours following extractions. The exception to this would be the patient on anticoagulants who is prescribed tranexamic acid, as discussed below. After 24 hours, you may gently rinse the mouth with a warm salt water solution (½ teaspoon salt in an 8 ounce glass of warm water) 4-5 times a day for several days. If bleeding continues, stop all mouth rinsing and follow instructions in paragraph 3 above regarding bleeding. Do not rinse with commercial mouthwashes. After 24 hours you may gently brush the teeth.<br><br>6. <strong>ANTIBIOTICS</strong> – If antibiotics have been prescribed for you, take them in accordance with the instructions on your prescription. Discontinue the antibiotics immediately if a rash, hives, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing occurs. This may be the sign of a serious allergic reaction. The patient who experiences difficulty breathing or swelling and constriction of the throat, mouth and face area should call 911 or their local emergency medical service, as serious allergic reactions can be fatal if not treated promptly. Notify the office so that a different antibiotic can be prescribed. Any infection should be taken seriously and reported to the office.<br><br>7. <strong>DIET</strong> – It is important to maintain a good diet. A liquid to soft diet is advisable for the first few days. It is very important to drink plenty of fluids (6-8 glasses per day). Avoid drinking very hot liquids as these may cause resorbable sutures to break down too quickly. Nutritional intake is very important during the healing stages following surgery. Now is not a good time to go on a diet. You should supplement your vitamin and mineral intake with a supplement such as Centrum, which is available both in tablet form as well as liquid form. Calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and manganese are important for proper bone healing and can be obtained in a single product form such as Caltrate Plus. A complete nutritional supplement such as Ensure can be taken to insure complete nutrition. Be very careful with anesthetized areas so you do not bite your lip, cheek, or tongue. Do not chew anything until after the numbness wears off. However, you can begin liquids right away provided that they are not too hot. Hard, crunchy foods should be avoided until healing is complete to avoid the possibility of jaw fracture.<br><br>8. <strong>POST-OPERATIVE OFFICE CARE</strong> – Most patients are seen approximately one week after surgery for evaluation and suture removal. If you have any doubts concerning your progress and recovery, please feel free to call the office. There may be a slight elevation in your temperature for 24-48 hours. If this continues, or if any other unusual events such as persistent weakness, lethargy, or malaise occur, please notify the office immediately. You may be seen sooner than one week if you so desire. If pain or swelling occurs after the surgical site has apparently healed, return for an examination. When this type of condition occurs, it usually happens on the third or fourth day after surgery. It may be indicative of a condition called “alveolar osteitis” (dry socket) and is generally treated by placing a medication into the tooth socket with almost immediate relief.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Special Instructions for Special Circumstances</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">1. <strong>NAUSEA</strong> – If you experience any nausea with your pain medicine, try taking it with milk, yogurt, ice cream or a milkshake. In rare cases, an anti-nausea drug may be prescribed. In very rare cases when nausea is so severe that the patient cannot keep oral medications down, anti-nausea medication can be administered in suppository form. While significant post-operative nausea is uncommon, it is more common in women and in patients with a history of motion sickness and migraine headaches.<br><br>2. <strong>EXCESSIVE PAIN</strong> – If you still experience pain after taking your prescription pain medication, you may add ibuprofen (such as Advil or Nuprin) or acetaminophen (such as Tylenol). The maximum adult daily dose of ibuprofen is 800 mg three times a day for a total of 2400 mg per day. The maximum adult daily dose of acetaminophen is 1000 mg four times a day for a total of 4000 mg per day. Keep in mind that many prescription pain medications (for example, Vicodin and Percocet) contain acetaminophen and some (for example, Vicoprofen) contain ibuprofen. If your pharmacist fills your prescription with a generic drug, note that the letters “APAP” on the label means that this product contains acetaminophen. Maximum daily doses include all sources of a drug added together. Acetaminophen taken in excess can cause liver failure and death, especially if combined with alcohol. Please be careful not to exceed the maximum daily dose.<br><br>3. <strong>ATTENTION WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE</strong> – Women of childbearing age should keep in mind that all antibiotics have the potential to interact with birth control pills and lessen the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive. Although this has never been proven, alternative nonhormonal forms of birth control should be used after checking with your physician and should be continued for one full week after antibiotics are completed. You should also continue to take your oral contraceptives according to their directions while you are using antibiotics.<br><br>4. <strong>ANTIBIOTIC MOUTH RINSES</strong> – You may receive a prescription for an antibiotic mouth rinse containing chlorhexidine (Peridex, PerioGard, etc.). Do not use this rinse for 24 hours following extractions. After 24 hours, you should use this rinse after meals and before bedtime until the surgery site has healed. Do not swallow the rinse – swish it gently and then spit it out. Although extremely effective against micro-organisms, these rinses may cause staining of your teeth. This is not permanent staining and it can be removed with professional polishing. Staining can be minimized by thoroughly brushing and flossing your teeth at least twice per day.<br><br>5. <strong>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATIENTS ON ANTICOAGULANTS AND PATIENTS WITH BLEEDING DISORDERS</strong> – If you are taking Coumadin (warfarin) or other anticoagulant medication or if you have a bleeding disorder, you may be given a special prescription for a mouthwash called tranexamic acid to minimize bleeding. Following the surgery appointment, rinse your mouth with 1 tablespoon for 2 minutes four times daily (every 6 hours) for 7 days. Do not swallow the rinse – swish it gently and then spit it out. Do not eat or drink during the first hour after using this mouthwash. Eat only a liquid diet on the first day after surgery. Contact the doctor if bleeding develops that cannot be controlled by compression by a gauze pad for twenty minutes while sitting upright.<br><br>6. <strong>SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS WITH IMMEDIATE DENTURES</strong> – If you have had immediate dentures placed at the time of surgery, it is extremely important that you do not remove these dentures for any reason until you are instructed to do so by the doctor. If the dentures are taken out too soon, there will most likely be additional swelling and it will be impossible to place the dentures in the mouth again. Please call the office for specific instructions as to when you should remove your immediate dentures.<br><br>7. <strong>BONE FRAGMENTS</strong> – During the healing process, small sharp fragments of bone may loosen and work through the gum. These fragments, which are not roots, usually work out on their own accord, but if they are annoying, return to the office so the dentist can advise or treat you.<br>8. <strong>SMOKING</strong> – Smoking will delay healing and may cause increased postoperative pain as well as the formation of a dry socket. Do not smoke for at least 48 hours after any type of oral surgery. This may be a good opportunity to seriously consider quitting smoking permanently.<br><br>9. <strong>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DIABETIC PATIENTS</strong> – Diabetic patients should note that blood glucose levels should be checked more frequently for the first few days following oral surgery. If you are eating less than usual or not eating regularly, you may need to adjust your insulin dosage. Please consult with your physician for additional guidance.<br><br>10. <strong>SINUS PRECAUTIONS – POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH SINUS INVOLVEMENT</strong> – Because of the close relationship between the upper back teeth and the sinus, a communication (also called a fistula) between the sinus and the mouth sometimes results from oral surgery. A communication between the sinus and the mouth often heals slowly. Certain precautions will assist healing and we ask that you carefully follow these instructions: Take prescription medication as directed. Do not smoke for at least two weeks. Smoking is a severe irritant and significantly delays healing. Do not forcefully blow your nose for at least two weeks, even though your sinuses may feel “stuffy” or there may be some nasal drainage. Try not to sneeze, as sneezing will cause an increase in sinus pressure. If you must sneeze, do so with your mouth open. Do not drink through a straw for at least two weeks. Do not forcefully spit for at least two weeks. Do not rinse vigorously for at least two weeks. Gentle saltwater swishes may be used as needed. Eat only soft foods for several days and chew on the opposite side of your mouth.<br><br>Slight bleeding from the nose may occur for several days after surgery. Please call the office if drainage or pain increases. It is very important that you keep all appointments until this complication has resolved. In rare cases, another surgical procedure may be necessary to close the communication between the mouth and the sinus.<br><br>10. <strong>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR IV SEDATION PATIENTS</strong> – Since you may be drowsy following the appointment, a responsible adult must escort you home. Two adults should accompany children. Arrange to have the entire day off work and limit your activities for the remainder of the day. Do not drive, operate machinery, drink alcohol, or make any important decisions or judgments for 24 hours after the appointment as your faculties and abilities will likely be impaired. Have someone assist you in and out of the car on your way home and up and down the stairs. Stand up slowly; if you are lying down, sit up first and then stand up slowly to avoid any drop in blood pressure that might make you dizzy. If you experience any unusual reactions, report them to the office as soon as possible. Occasionally, the injection site of the IV may become inflamed and tender. This is caused by the anesthesia drugs irritating the vein. If this happens, apply moist heat to the area and the inflammation will eventually resolve.<br><br>Please feel free to call anytime you have a question or concern.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Post-Op Instructions – Extractions</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">The post-operative instructions listed below should be followed accurately in order to speed your recovery. Please avoid rinsing today. Beginning tomorrow rinse with warm salt water (one-half teaspoon salt to one cup water) every two to three hours for several days, then after meals and at bedtime for the next two weeks. You may also begin brushing your teeth tomorrow. Please note that a gradual increase in pain from days three to five is not uncommon. Keep your head elevated at all times for the first five to seven days following surgery. This will help decrease swelling and pain. Our office typically uses stitches that are designed to dissolve and fall out on their own. Depending on the type, this may occur within the first week or within two to three weeks.<br><br>DO NOT SMOKE. Smoking in any amount in the first few weeks can cause a dry socket and will dramatically delay wound healing. You may eat or drink what you feel up to once the local anesthetic has worn off. Avoid very hot foods or liquids for 24 hours. Soft foods like eggs, pastas, warm soups and yogurt are recommended. Drink plenty of fluids, but do not drink through a straw or create a sucking action in your mouth. The surgical site may continue to bleed slightly for a day or two. This is no cause for alarm. If heavy bleeding occurs, fold a piece of gauze (or use a wet or dry tea bag) and place over the bleeding area. Maintain firm pressure for 30 minutes.<br><br>Avoid frequent pack changes, rinsing, and spitting or physical exertion until the bleeding has ceased. DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages, drive or operate machinery for 12 hours following general anesthesia.<br><br>DO NOT combine pain medication with alcohol. Some discomfort is to be expected and you may be rather uncomfortable for the first few hours or days. Please:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Take the prescribed medication with food as directed.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Allow 45 minutes for the medication to work. Therefore, take the medication before the pain becomes too severe.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Take Ibuprofen (Advil) 800mg every six hours for minor discomfort or in between doses of pain medication to increase effectiveness.</span></li>
</ul><span class="font-size-m">Swelling is to be expected and usually reaches its maximum during the first three days. Apply ice to the side of the face 15 minutes on and 15 minutes off as often as possible for the first 48 hours. Frozen vegetable bags wrapped in dishtowels work nicely as they contour to the jaw. Change to heat (a heating pad or hot water bottle) 48 hours after surgery. Continue to use heat until the swelling has receded.<br><br>Bruising may occur, especially along the jaw line. This is not unexpected and should disappear soon. Keep lips moist with ChapStick or Vaseline to prevent chapping. Tightness of the jaw muscles may make it difficult for you to open your mouth for up to two weeks. If you have been prescribed an antibiotic and are currently taking oral contraceptives you should use an alternate method of birth control for the remainder of this cycle. If any unusual symptoms occur or if you have any questions concerning your progress, we may be reached 24 hours a day by calling 858-592-0234.<br><strong>CEREC Post-Treatment Instructions</strong><br>Congratulations! You have just received the finest dental restoration advanced technology dentistry has to offer. Your CEREC ceramic restoration has replaced a portion of the tooth that has been damaged over time. With proper care it should provide years and years of service, as though your tooth were virtually re-enameled.<br><br><strong>Sensitivity</strong><br>Mild to moderate sensitivity to hot or cold food or drink is expected following placement of any bonded dental restoration. Typically, this sensitivity gradually diminishes over a period of a few weeks. A very small percentage of bonded ceramic restorations display sensitivity that persists for longer periods of time. If this continues for more than six weeks, please inform us – it could be a sign that your tooth has nerve damage and may require further treatment to alleviate the problem.<br><br><strong>Chewing</strong><br>Avoid chewing hard foods for 24 hours in order to allow the bonding to achieve its maximum strength. Aggressive chewing on such things as ice or peanuts should be avoided for two weeks.<br><br><strong>Your Bite</strong><br>It is not unusual for your bite to be off-balance after a ceramic restoration is placed. We adjust the bite immediately after placing it, however the numb feeling often does not allow for proper refinement of the bite at the time of treatment. Please contact our office to schedule an adjustment if needed.<br><br><strong>Hygiene Visits</strong><br>To keep your warranty in effect, visit us for your routine hygiene visits. Often, small problems can develop around the restorations can be corrected, if found early. The most often cited reason for failure of any dental restoration is failure to return for your routine hygiene visits.<br><br>Preventative Procedures Brush and floss after eating and before bedtime. Rinse vigorously for at least 30 seconds daily with a recommended fluoride rinse product such as fluorigard or ACT rinse. The best time is just prior to bed. Use a fluoride toothpaste or a toothpaste containing chlorine dioxide such as Oxygene.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Composite Fillings – Post Treatment Instructions</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Composite fillings set up hard right away. There is no waiting time to eat. Children should be observed until the anesthetic wears off. Due to the strange feeling of the anesthetic, many children will chew the inside of their lips, cheeks, or tongue which can cause serious damage.<br><br>Sensitivity to hot and cold is common for a few weeks following dental restoration. Usually, the deeper the cavity, the more sensitive the tooth will be. If you feel the bite is not correctly balanced, please call for an appointment for a simple adjustment.<br><br>The gum tissue could have been irritated during the procedure and may be sore for a few days along with the anesthetic injection site.<br><br>The finished restoration may be contoured slightly different and have a different shape than the original tooth. Your tongue usually magnifies this small difference and will become adjusted to this in a few days.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Fixed Crowns or Bridges – Post Treatment Instructions</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">You have just had some crowns or fixed bridges cemented onto your teeth. They will replace your missing tooth structure or missing teeth very well and should give you years of service if you will observe the following suggestions:<br><br><strong>CHEWING:</strong> Do not chew hard or sticky foods on the restorations for 24 hours from the time they are cemented. The cement must mature to have optimum strength.<br><br><strong>CONTINUING CARE:</strong> Visit us at regular intervals as discussed with your doctor or hygienist. Often problems that are developing around restorations can be found at an early stage and corrected easily, while waiting for a longer time may require redoing the entire restoration. <strong>Inadequate return for examination is the most significant reason for protheses failure.</strong> We will contact you when it is time for your appointment.<br><br><strong>PREVENTIVE PROCEDURES:</strong> Use the following preventive procedures that are checked: Brushing and flossing after eating and especially before bedtime. Swish vigorously with Colgate FLUORIGARD or Johnson &amp; Johnson ACT mouthrinse for 30 seconds daily before bedtime (.05% neutral sodium fluoride). Brush with Colgate Prevident or Gel Kam (0.4% stannous fluoride) daily before bedtime.(This is available in our office.) Use the Rotodent as advised by us. Use bridge cleaners as advised by us.<br><br><strong>SENSITIVITY:</strong> Don’t worry about mild sensitivity to hot or cold foods. It will disappear gradually over a few weeks.<br><br><strong>AGGRESSIVE CHEWING:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> chew ice or other very hard objects. Avoid chewing very sticky “hard tacky” candy because it can remove restorations.<br><br><strong>PROBLEMS:</strong> If one or more of the following conditions occurs, please contact us to avoid further problems: A feeling of movement or looseness in the restoration. Sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods that doesn’t disappear in a few weeks. A peculiar taste from the restoration site. Breakage of a piece of material from the restoration. Sensitivity to pressure.<br>We have done our best to provide you with the finest quality oral restorations available today. However, as with a fine automobile or watch, only your continuing care and concern can assure optimum service longevity.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Porcelain Veneers – Patient Instructions</strong><br><strong>First 72 Hours</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">The resin bonding process takes at least 72 hours to cure in its entirety. During this time, you should avoid any hard foods and maintain a relatively soft diet. Extremes in temperature (either hot or cold) should also be avoided. Alcohol and some medicated mouthwashes have the potential to affect the resin bonding material during this early phase and should not be used.<br><br>Maintenance Routine cleanings are a must at least every four months with a hygienist, who should avoid using an ultrasonic scaler and the air abrasion systems. Use a soft toothbrush with rounded bristles, and floss as you do with natural teeth. If daily cleaning of plaque is a problem, use a mechanical plaque removal device (Interplak), because plaque-free maintenance of these restorations is essential to their longevity and the health of your teeth and supportive tissues. Use a less abrasive toothpaste and one that is not highly fluoridated. Although laminates are strong, avoid excessive biting forces and habit patterns: nail biting, pencil chewing etc. Avoid biting into hard pieces of candy, chewing on ice, eating ribs. Use a soft acrylic mouthguard when involved in any form of contact sport.<br><br><strong>Mouth Rinses</strong><br>Acidulated fluoridated mouth rinses can damage the surface finish of your laminates and should be avoided. Chlorhexidine antiplaque mouthrinses may stain your laminates, but the stain can be readily removed by a hygienist.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Instructions for Complete Denture Patients</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Patients normally look forward to the day when they receive their new dentures. They are happy about the prospect that former dental problems will soon be over. Then, the day arrive then the new dentures are inserted and they are frequently shocked that a new array of dental problems are just beginning. In order to receive the maximum service and satisfaction from new dentures, the patient must understand certain relevant and pertinent facts – whether they have previously worn dentures or not. Many misconceptions and erroneous ideas exist concerning the use and care of complete dentures.<br><br>Printed instructions have an important role in modern informed consent; and it is essential that the expectations of the patient and dentist are alike. It must be emphasized that both the dentist and the patient have an important role in the outcome of the complete denture service. The following patient instructions are based on the research and experience of many prosthodontists, over many years, and are intended to provide practical methots for mastering the use and care of new dentures.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>The art and science of prosthetic dentistry had advanced rapidly during recent years and new techniques and materials have greatly improved our abillity to replace missing tissues with functional and natural looking artificial appliances or prostheses. However, it must be remembered from the outset that no prosthesis or artificaial substitue, regardless of how painstaikingly fabricated, will ever function as efficiently as the original living tissues. Research has shown that the chewing efficiency of experienced denture patiens is, at best, less than twenty percent as efficient as the average chewing efficiency of patients with natural teeth.<br><br>Your mental attitude and adaptability are of utmost importance to learning to use new dentures. Do not expect too much from them, especially at first. The dentist can only provide the denture treatment and then advise you. You must have the patience and perseverance to learn to use the dentures.<br>Just as learning to swim, or skate, or ski, or ride a bicycle can be traumatic experiences, so it may be learning to use new dentures. These are all physical skills that must be learned and no one is an expert in the beginning. The length of time required to learn to use dentures varies and depends on many factors such as age, general health, nutrition, muscle tone, tissue condition, coordination, and mental attitude. Since no two patients are exactly alike, all patients cannot expect the same degree of skill or success in using dentures. However, it should be remembered that millions of other people have learned this skill and the odds are likely that you will too.<br>Please beware of relatives and friends who are denture wearers. Most dentures wearers consider themselves experts on the subject and are eager to give you advice based on their experience. Such advice can be inaccurate and harmful to you. Seek the advice of only one expert, your dentist, who has the training and experience to treat your specific problems.<br><br>Many denture patients would like to ignore the fact that they are, to a degree, handicapped. It is evident that a man with an artificial leg would have great difficulty becoming a professional football player. The denture patient must also learn to live with certain limitations. Since you will be wearing dentures from now on, it is no disgrace to use them in a manner that will help insure your ability to wear them in the future. Despite the limitations, your dentures will restore your appearance, speech and ability to chew – when you master their use.<br><br><strong>The First Few Days</strong><br>For the first days after receiving new dentures you should expect only to be able to keep the dentures in your mouth. Chewing should be limited to soft foods and the dentures should be worn all night the first night only. Dentists normally insist on an adjustment the next day. Movement of the dentures during function sometimes causes red spots to develop during the first 24 hours which would become painful denture ulcers, if not treated.<br><br>Some patients experience an initial abundance of saliva which is stimulated by the presence of the new dentures. Soon the salivary glands will adjust to the presence of the dentures and resume their normal production. Until then, you should simply swallow more frequently.<br><br>Occasionally, patients experience a gagging sensation when they first begin to wear dentures. Gagging is a reaction that will gradually disappear as the dentures are worn. Do not insist that the upper denture is too long. Anatomic landmarks determine the exact length of the denture and the seal or suction will be destroyed if the denture is shortened. If this problem occurs, consult your dentist, but remember that this is a problem that you must largely overcome through perseverance.<br><br>Frequently patients have the sensation that the tongue is too confined and interferes with the stability of the lower denture. This is particularly true if the back teeth have been missing a long time or if a previous denture was not properly below the flattened, filling the space of the missing teeth. As the new denture is worn, the tongue will retain its muscle tone and become narrower and more rounded. The dentist may thin the tongue sides of the denture to help this problem.<br><br>Denture irritations or sore spots will invariably develop and will require adjustment by the dentist. These irritations are caused by movement of the denture during function. Time is available each week for such appointments, so please call and reserve a time if problems develop. Never attempt to adjust or repair a denture yourself. If an area is particularly sore, leave the denture our as much as possible until the day of the adjustment appointment and rinse your mouth frequently with warm salt rinses.<br><br>Difficulty in speaking is another hurdle which must be overcome with patience and practice. Speech patterns will improve only after the tissues of the mouth become accustomed to the new dentures and control of the lower denture is learned. If you watch yourself in a mirror and say the sounds that give you trouble, this sometimes helps the speech “computer” adapt to the new dentures.<br><br><strong>Mastication (Chewing)</strong><br>The greatest problem by far is relearning to eat. Eating with complete dentures is quite different from eating with natural teeth. Natural teeth are embedded in bone and have individual sensory nerves capable of sensing pain, pressure and temerature. A denture, however, functions as a single tooth, is anchored to nothing, feels nother, and rests on soft, movable tissues covering the jaw bones.<br><br>If a denture is to remain stable during chewing, the forces of chewing must be distributed uniformly over the denture bearing surfaces. Forces applied to only one side of the denture will compress the tissue under that side, while tipping the other side away from the tissue and breaking the seal. Although some patient are proud of the fact that they can take bites out of such things as apples and corn-on-the-cob, it must be pointed out that dentures were never intended for biting things off with the front teeth. A denture is like a canoe – if you stand up in front of a canoe, it will tent to upset. The long term relust of this practice is damage to the underlying bone.<br>One solution to the problem of chewing with complete dentures is learning to chew simultaneously on both sides. Brittle foods such as saltine crackers may offer good practice. Place half a small cracker on one side and half on the other side. Attempt to chew slowly and thoroughly and then swallow. At first, this two-sided chewing may seem difficult because we tend to chew on one side onlay with natural teeth. Two-sided chewing can be learning and it is probably better to chew on both sides at once with complete dentures.<br><br>Get in the habit early, especially in social situations, of selecting foods which can be eaten with a knife and fork. Cut the food into very small bites which can be placed on the back teeth. Methodically chew on both sides at once until it can be swallowed. Gradually, this process will become natural and rarely will anyone be aware of your denture limitations – unless you call attention to them yourself. Some patients find that the use of commercial denture adhesives are helpful during this learning period and they often become accustomed to the confidence proveded by additional adhesion.<br><br>Certain foods are often avoided by denture patients, i.e., tough fibrous meats, tough breads and hard rolls. Tiny, hard particles that cannot be softened by saliva can be extremely painful if they get under the dentures. Examples are strawberry and raspberry seeds and particles of nuts and carrots. Sticky substances such as chewing gum and caramels can stick to the dentures and should be avoided.<br>Proper nutrition and fluid balance are important to both your general health and to your success in wearing dentures. Taking a daily mulitple vitamin is recommended. Avoid the usual tendency to overindulg in doft carbohydrates (sweets) that are high in calories and low in food value. A well balanced diet should contain some daily portion of the following types of food: low fat milk, cheese, bread, cereals, meats (especially fish or fowl), green and yellow vegetables, fruit and water (2 quarts per day).<br><br>Above all, wear the dentures at mealtime despite the difficulties. Do not become discouraged. Don’t fall back on the “crutch” of using old dentures or doing without. This will only prolong the adjustment period. Remember, millions have learned these skills and you can too.<br><br><strong>Mouth and Denture Care</strong><br>Dentures should remain out of the mouth for an eight hour period during each twenty four hours. This period is essential for the long-term health of the denture supporting tissues. Research had shown that certain pathologic conditions occur only if the dentures are worn continuously. The gums stay healthier and jaw bones shrink less with a daily rest period. Most patients find it convenient to rest the mouth during sleeping. Taking the dentures out at night has thus become the recommended procedure.<br><br>Dentures tend to collect even more food debris that natural teeth. Dentures must be removed from the mouth and cleaned after eating and before retiring at night. The complete denture patient should have two brushes, a denture brush for cleaning the dentures and a soft toothbrush for brushing the gums and tongue. The denture brush had a small tuft of bristles on one side which help clean inside the denture. Please do not use toothpaste on the dentures. The abrasives in regular toothpaste polish enamel without damage but can be damaging over time to the plastic denture bases and artificial teeth. Use a dentifrice made specifically for dentures, or simply soak them with liquid soap or plain water. Since the plastic denture material is breakable, it is an excellent idea to brush the dentures over a sink partially filled with water. Many dentures have been broken by dropping them into an empty sink.<br><br>Remember that tartar or calculus can form on dentures just as on natural teeth. Stain and tartar generally do not form on dentures that are thoroughly brushed daily. Remember also that “denture breath” is caused by unclean dentures in an unclean mouth.<br><br>Whenever dentures are out of the mouth they should be stored in clean water. Failure to keep dentures wet results in the material drying out and warpage can occur. Dentutres should be stored overnight in a denture cup and commercial denture cleaner may be used if desired. Such cleaners can make drntures taste and smell better but should not be considered a substitute for brushing.<br><br><strong>Future Denture Service</strong><br>As a child develops, his or her jaw bones grow for the purpose of supporting the teeth. When the teeth are removed, the body knows that bone is no longer needed, and the bone that supports the teeth immediately begins to shrink away. This shrinkage is greatest during the first year after teeth are removed but continues slowly in a chronic, progressive, and irreversible manner throughout life. The lower jaw shrinks four times faster than the upper jaw. Studies have shown that wearing dentures accelerates this process. It is generally accepted that changes in the jaw bones and soft tissues occur in six to ten years to require the construction of new dentures. However, there is wide variation among patients and sometimes the internal surface needs to be updated earlier by what is called a reline procedure.<br><br>For the reline procedure, and impression is made inside the denture between the current inside denture base and the existing ridge. Acrylic is reprocessed to refit the denture. This does not change the apperaance, teeth, or bite on the denture. While this will improve the fit of the denture, you may have to readjust to the relined denture just as if they are a new set of dentures and all thier associated problems.<br><br>Since we know the tissues of the mouth were never intended to support artificial dentures, and that dentures can damage these tissues, it is important for denture patients to be examined by the dentist at least once each year. Any unusual changes in the mouth should be reported to the dentist immediately. Patients who use tobacco and drink consist of an oral examination to evaluate the fit and bite of the denture, an oral cancer evaluation, and cleaning of the dentures.<br><br>There are some patients who never master the use of complete dentures. Perhaps they cannot learn to keep the lower denture stable enough to chew, or perhaps they cannot get accustomed to having the whole palate covered by the denture. In the past, little could be done for these patients. Today, such problems can often be managed through the use of dental implants. For example, as few as two dental implants can markedly improve the retention and stability of a lower denture. Implants are alawys a better alternative to traditional denture retention and support. However, some patients might need extensive and expensive bone grafting to receive implants thus making implant treatment complex and lengthy. Even if obtaining implant treatment is not easy, it is still a better alternative to traditional denture therapy.<br><br>Finally, with regard to denture breakage and repairs, please avoid super glue and do-it-yourself reline and repair kits. These products generally delay proper treatment and increase the risk of injury to your<br><strong>Sleep Apnea-Snoring Device Information</strong><br>You have just received your oral sleep apnea/snoring device. Initially, when the appliance is placed in your mouth you will, most likely, find it cumbersome. There will be an increase in salivary flow for the first few weeks of use which will slowly subside. Some patients experience minor gagging or awkwardness swallowing, but these sensations are not permanent. After wearing the appliance all night it is common to have some minor tooth or muscle discomfort. Many patients cannot touch their teeth together normally for up to 45 minutes. If this is a problem, lean on your hand for about 15 minutes each morning, as if you were the statue of “The Thinker” by Rodin. Most patients experience little if any discomfort after a few weeks of adapting to their intra-oral sleep apnea device.<br><br>Cleaning your intra-oral sleep apnea appliance should be done each morning with a toothbrush and toothpaste, brushing all surfaces – inside and out. Use of ORAL SAFE appliance cleaner is a very effective product and is available from Great Lakes Laboratories. Soft appliances may be stored dry.<br><br>The appliances can cause soft tissue irritation, minor tooth movement (lower anterior crowding) and, occasionally, it can dislodge ill-fitting crowns and fillings in the area where the metal clasps hold on to the teeth. If you experience significant joint or muscle pain lasting more than 2 hours or requiring analgesic medication, discontinue use of the appliance and call my office at (855) 464-0063 and make an appointment for reevaluation. Routine appointments for adjustment of the device consist of a series of appointments over 3-4 months.<br><br>A small percentage of patients actually increase their number of apneic and hypopneic events when using an oral appliance. If your symptoms seem to increase, contact my office immediately.<br><br>Be careful that you do not leave the appliance anywhere that a pet can reach it. Dogs find them wonderful chew toys and replacement of the appliance is not covered by medical insurance. Do not leave it in a car on a hot day, or in your luggage when flying.<br><br>If you have any questions about the use and care of you intra-oral sleep apnea / snoring device please do not hesitate to bring them to my attention at your next appointment or by calling 855-464-0063.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Scaling and Root Planing: Post-procedure Instructions</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">The dental prophylaxis just completed has been preventive in nature due to your thorough oral self-care. That means that there was no gum disease evident. The prophylaxis was completed quickly and with the minimum of trauma to your teeth and soft tissues. In this event, you should have insignificant postoperative discomfort in your mouth. Congratulations on a job well done. Keep up the good work. We would rather assist you in preventing periodontal disease than in curing the problems periodontal disease can cause.<br><br>A therapeutic prophylaxis has been completed. In this case, the gingival (gum) tissue showed signs of infection and inflammation and you may have had significant calculus (tartar) buildup. You may notice that your teeth feel different where the calculus was removed. The soft tissues may be sensitive or sore for approximately one day as they begin to heal. You may find that taking an over-the-counter pain reliever (aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.) will help during this 24-hour period. You may also rinse your mouth every few hours with warm salt water. Make sure that you brush and floss your teeth during this time period as you have been instructed. Be gentle, because the brushed areas may be sore, but be thorough! You do not want to have the periodontal infection begin again.<br><br>When you have had scaling and root planing, or other more involved periodontal procedures, you can expect your gingival (gum) tissues to be quite sore. This is normal when the gum tissues have been infected and inflamed for some time. The more severely they have been affected, the more discomfort you can expect. This soreness should go away very quickly. You may rinse with warm salt water every few hours until the soreness is gone.<br>You may also notice that the teeth have become sensitive to temperature changes after the scaling and root planing. This sensation frequently occurs when the surfaces of the roots of your teeth have been cleaned. Removal of the debris covering the roots and attached to the roots leaves the roots open to temperature stimulus. If the problem persists, please let us know.<br><br>When you examine your gums closely in a mirror, you will also observe that the color, texture, and position of your periodontal tissues will undergo a change as the healing takes place. The swollen, reddened gum tissue will shrink, become more firm, and return to a healthy pink color. Watch for these welcome signs of improvement and be encouraged by the healing process.<br><br>Please do not forget to brush, floss, and use other periodontal cleaning aids as you have been taught. It is important that you begin establishing proper oral self-care habits immediately. If you find that the recently treated areas are sensitive to the brushing and flossing, be gentle, but be thorough! With proper technique you cannot damage the teeth or gingival tissues.<br><br>Brush after every meal with a fluoride-containing toothpaste.

Professional dental cleaning and implant maintenance by a hygienist at your recommended intervals is essential.<br><br><strong>CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br>In general, care of your dental implants is much like the care you give your natural teeth. Those patients who enjoy the greatest success with implants are those who follow a program of immaculate plaque removal. These suggestions can help:<br><strong>Brushing:</strong> When using a standard toothbrush, be sure to clean in and around all implant posts. Many people find that an electric toothbrush is easiest to use.<br><br><strong>Flossing:</strong> When implants are not attached to adjacent teeth, you may floss implants as you do your natural teeth. However, several teeth may be attached together in an implant supported “bridge or bur”. In such cases, “floss threaders” or “Superfloss” are used to run floss under these areas for easy cleaning. Special “wide” floss may be recommended depending upon your individual implant structure.<br><br><strong>Interproximal Brushes:</strong> While they are not a replacement for dental floss, these tiny dental brushes can offer additional help in cleaning hard to reach places.<br><br><strong>Oral Irrigators:</strong> Can help in reducing bacterial plaque accumulation around both dental implants and natural teeth. A special mouth rinse may also be recommended.<br><br>Contact our office if you experience any of the following:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Looseness in a dental implant</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Dull or sharp pain when chewing</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Swelling or redness in the gums surrounding the implant site(s)</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Endodontic Treatment (Root Canal) – Post-Operative Instructions</strong><br>1. Root canal treatment can take 1,2, or more appointments, depending on the conditions present in each case. During that time any of the following symptoms may be present: sensitivity to hot or cold, sensitivity to pressure, or swelling.<br><br>2. Some tenderness can be expected after each appointment. It is best to start taking either an over-the-counter pain medicine (Advil or Motrin 200 mg., or Tylenol), or the pain medicine prescribed to you. These are most effective if taken before the office anesthetic wears off.<br><br>3. If an antibiotic has been prescribed to you, be certain to take it as directed. Be certain to finish all the pills regardless of how well you feel.<br><br>4. If swelling or pain is present after 2 days of your last appointment or is increasing, your medication may need to be adjusted. Contact the office immediately.<br><br>5. If your bite feels high or if pain occurs with light biting, your bite may to be adjusted due to inflammation around the tooth. This is a short appointment. Please call the office immediately.<br><br>6. A temporary has been placed in the tooth. This restoration is not very durable and is prone to breakage or dislodgment if not treated carefully. Avoid sticky foods (gum, taffy, caramels, etc.), and hard foods (chewing ice, nuts and hard candy).<br><br>7. Floss your temporary restoration gently. Just clean and pull floss out to the side (do not bring the floss up), so temporary filling will not “pop off”.<br><br>8. The tooth is often very weak during therapy. Avoid biting on hard objects until the tooth is properly restored with a filling or crown after therapy is completed.<br><br>9. Hot food or beverage can be harmful to anesthetized tissues. Please avoid drinking hot coffee, etc., until the numbness wears off.<br><br>10. Should you have greater than expected sensitivity, discomfort on biting, if your temporary filling becomes loose or broken, please call the office immediately.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Self Care for Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD)</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Your lower jaw meets the upper skull in front of the ear. The joint that connects then is called the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ). Noises in the jaw joints are extremely common and the disk that separates the jaws has been estimated to be displaced in approximately 40% of the population. Like any joint (hip, shoulder, wrist), the TMJ can be strained or injured. The injury can be the result of a specific trauma to the jaw area or can result from prolonged smaller trauma (microtrauma) from oral habits.<br><br>Jaw pain and difficulty with jaw movement are common signs of problems with the jaw joint or jaw muscles. These problems as a group are called temporomandibular disorders, or TMD, and they can often improve with some basic home care. Heat or ice can reduce joint or muscle pain and relax the muscles.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Moist Heat: Moist heat can be especially helpful to sore muscles when applied to the painful area of the jaw for 15-20 minutes 3-4 times a day. A wet towel over a hot water bottle or a gel type heat pack can be used. A wet wash cloth heated in a microwave can also be used. Avoid burning the skin.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Ice: Ice treatment can also be helpful for a sore jaw joint. An ice cube can be placed directly over the jaw joint in front of the ear. Move the ice over the jaw joint for 4-5 minutes for 3-4 times a day. Avoid frosting the skin.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Soft Diet:</strong> A simple rule of thumb is to avoid chewing foods which aggravate the pain and/ or jaw clicking such as French bread, bagels, or steak. Cook foods of softer consistency and cut food into smaller bites. It is helpful to avoid biting off food with the front teeth. Place the smaller pieces of food directly in the back of the mouth and chew on both sides to avoid overloading one side.<br><br><strong>Chewing Gum:</strong> Do not chew gum. Chewing gum places a lot of pressure on the jaw joints for extended periods of time.<br><br><strong>Jaw Position:</strong> Normal rest position of the jaw is with the teeth slightly separated and the tip of the tongue in the roof of the mouth behind your front teeth. This is a relaxed position with no tense jaw muscles. The teeth should only touch when chewing and swallowing. Check your jaw position several times during the day to see if you clench your teeth.<br><br><strong>Jaw Habits:</strong> Check yourself and ask your family or friends if you have any habits which might make your jaw problem worse. These include teeth clenching or grinding, lip or cheek biting, fingernail biting, pen biting, thrusting your jaw forward, resting your jaw on your hand, and bracing your jaw even with your teeth apart.<br><br><strong>Dental Appointments:</strong> Avoid extended mouth opening at the dentist while you are having jaw pain. Let your dentist or hygienist know you have been having problems with your jaw.<br><br><strong>Caffeine:</strong> Avoid excessive use of caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or colas, as these can contribute to jaw muscle tension and pain. Keep our caffeine use to 2 or less beverages per day. Sleeping<br><br><strong>Position:</strong> Attempt to not sleep on your stomach, as this can put pressure on the jaw. Medications: Over the counter medications such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or Tylenol can be helpful in reducing your jaw pain. Take these medications as prescribed on the product instructions.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Oral Hygiene – Post Treatment Home Care</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">We want you to keep your teeth and gums healthy for a lifetime. We are happy to explain and demonstrate proper home care. However, responsibility for your oral health ultimately lies with you. Yes, it is really up to you to keep things on the right track. If you do the following every day, you will significantly increase the likelihood of a lifetime of good oral health.<br><br><strong>Floss</strong><br>Floss is used to remove plaque and whatever else decides to take refuge on your teeth, both above and below the gum line. Plaque refers to the bacteria and other things that stick to your teeth. There is direct connection between plaque, gum disease and tooth decay. Therefore, if you don’t remove the plaque, you will get gum disease and tooth decay.<br>Glide Floss is one of top floss products currently available. It is designed not to shred or get caught on your teeth or fillings. Take about an 18 inch length of floss and wrap it around your 2 middle fingers. Hold about a 1 inch length of this floss between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, keeping it tight. Gently place this 1 inch tight piece between the tooth contact. When you reach the gum line, hold the floss against one tooth and move it into the space between the gum and tooth below the gum line. While keeping the floss in contact with the tooth, move it up and down along the side of the tooth, from just below the contact to as far as you can comfortably get below the gum line. It is important that you get the floss in the space between the gum and tooth, as this is where gum disease begins. Repeat this procedure for the tooth on the other side of the contact. As you move from tooth to tooth, use a fresh section of floss.<br><br>If you haven’t flossed in awhile, your gums may bleed at first when you do this. If you are doing it correctly (and at least once a day), your gums will start to heal and the bleeding should stop in no more than 2 weeks.<br><br><strong>Brush/Toothpaste</strong><br>Brushing removes plaque and food debris on the chewing, inside and outside tooth surfaces. After flossing, use a soft brush along with a fluoride containing brand-name toothpaste. For the inside and outside surfaces, hold the brush at a 45 degree angle to the teeth and gums and use a gentle back-and-forth motion. This technique will not only clean your teeth, it will also keep your gums healthy. It is important to have the brush contact the teeth and gums at the same time. On the chewing surfaces hold the brush flat and use a gentle scrubbing motion.<br>Brush for two minutes. That is a long time, but it will be much more effective than the 20-30 seconds that most people do. Since two minutes standing by the sink is much longer than most people think, you may benefit by using a toothbrush timer. Brush at least 2 times a day, especially in the morning and at bedtime.<br><br>When done, spit out as much as you can. Don’t swallow any of the toothpaste, and don’t rinse out with any water.<br><br><strong>Scrape</strong><br>A tongue scraper is great for removing bacteria and food debris on the tongue. These substances get stuck in the deep crevices of your tongue, and if not removed, the byproducts give you bad breath. After brushing, a tongue scraper followed by a rinse is frequently the best way to control bad breath.<br><br>The tongue scraper we give you has two sides, regular and soft. Usually you will use the regular side.<br><br>Hold the scraper with two hands, between the thumbs and forefingers. Bend the scraper so that it forms a “C”. Stick out your tongue and start scraping from back to front several times. You will notice a creamy film develop on the scraper. Rinse it off. Repeat the scraping and rinsing until the film coming off your tongue is clear.<br><br>Rinse and dry the tongue scraper. It is designed to last a long time.<br><br><strong>Rinse</strong><br>An antibacterial rinse is just that, a rinse that cuts down on the bacteria that causes gum disease and cavities, plus it reduces those bacteria and the bacterial byproducts that cause bad breath. After scraping your tongue, it is recommended that you use a non-alcoholic anti-bacterial rinse, such as BreathRx or Crest Pro Health Rinse. This will significantly decrease the bacteria and volatile sulfur compounds (the substances responsible for bad breath). It will improve the health of your mouth and you will be a delight to be near. Why a non-alcoholic rinse? Most mouth rinses (such as Scope) contain a high percentage of alcohol. Alcohol dries your mouth out. Just put some alcohol on your hand and observe how quickly the skin dries out. Using a mouth rinse with a high alcohol content may make your mouth smell nice for only a short period of time. Once the alcohol begins drying the tongue and gums, your breath can actually smell worse than before you used it. Therefore, an alcoholic mouth rinse is not recommended.<br><br>Use a very small amount (you need less than you think) of mouth rinse and swish for 10-15 seconds and spit it out. No rinsing with water.<br><br><strong>Remember:</strong> You don’t have to clean all your teeth; only the ones you want to keep. Congratulations!

Why do you need to have regular dental care check-ups?</strong><br>A. Regular check-ups are needed to monitor your overall oral health. In addition to checking for cavities, your dentist examines the health of your entire mouth and surrounding soft tissues, checking for pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, oral sores, and gum disease.<br><br>Your oral health is connected with your general health. Dental care check-ups can alert the dentist to other medical conditions that have symptoms in the mouth such as diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, and hormonal irregularities. Regular <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/439/emergency-dental">dental care visits</a> are vital to prevent tooth decay, gum disease, and other conditions affecting your mouth.<br><br><strong>Q. What can you do to feel more relaxed during a dental care appointment?</strong><br>A. With the combination of modern anesthetics and new conscious sedation dentistry technology and techniques, many procedures only have minimal discomfort or are now entirely painless. Dental care providers want their patients to have maximum comfort and approach their treatments with a relaxed attitude and less dental anxiety.<br><br>There are a number of ways to decrease dental anxiety:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Tell the dental care staff your concerns. Studies have shown that talking about your fears of possible discomfort actually reduces pain.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Use visualization to picture yourself relaxed, or repeat messages that have a calming effect.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Play your favorite music on a walkman you bring with you (some dental offices are equipped with walkmans, too.)</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Arrange a signal with the dental care staff, such as raising your hand, if you need a break or feel discomfort.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">Some dental care offices are now offering patients new options for stress-relief: hypnosis, self-hypnosis instructions, relaxation tapes, soft lighting, warm gel-filled eye masks, scented candles, and massaging pillows. These are helpful in reducing stress in patients that suffer from dental anxiety. Be sure to avoid the use of stimulants such as caffeine prior to your visit.<br><br><strong>Q. Aromatherapy has a relaxing effect for many people. Is this effective for patients undergoing dental treatment?</strong><br>A. Research studies conducted at Case Western Reserve University have noted that the use of aromatherapy has a significant positive effect on dental anxiety patients. Two-thirds of the patients receiving aromatherapy were more calm and relaxed than those patients without exposure to the scented fragrance oils.<br><br>Dentists are concerned about your comfort. Ask your dental provider if aromatherapy is available in the office to help reduce dental anxiety, or if you can bring your own for your dental care visit. Essential fragrance oils are available in health food stores, spas, and some grocery and drug store outlets.<br><br><strong>Q. Are dental patients who are considered at risk for bacterial infections advised to take antibiotic medication prior to their appointments?</strong><br>A. Certain medical conditions, such as heart valve problems or a recent total joint replacement, are considered at risk for infection at the site of the cardiac abnormality or joint replacement. This infection results from bacteria from the mouth entering the bloodstream and working its way to these vulnerable areas.<br><br>Consequently, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dental care</a> procedures likely to result in bleeding from the gums or mucous membranes will require patients to take antibiotics prior to that procedure. Such procedures could include, but are not limited to, extractions, implant surgery, incision and drainage for oral infection, and professional teeth cleaning.<br><br>Guidelines have been established by the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association to provide dentists and physicians with information regarding appropriate regimens for antibiotic therapy. It also outlines those situations when antibiotic therapy is or is not indicated.<br><br>There also are other medical conditions warranting antibiotic therapy prior to dental procedures. Be sure to update your dentist regarding your medical history. Your dentist and/or physician will advise you of any special needs.<br><br><strong>Q. Where can you receive dental services if you do not have the money to cover the related expense?</strong><br>A. If you do not have either <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental insurance</a> or the money to pay for a dental visit, you should inquire about financial aid from various sources within your community.<br><br>You may need to make several calls, but the local dental society, the local public health department, or social service agencies may be able to direct you to sources of assistance. Also, check local hospitals, dental schools, and outreach clinics that may be able to provide dental services at a reduced fee.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Enjoy Your Dentists and the Dentistry Your Parents Never Had</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">What did your parents tell you about going to the dentist?

How does one care for primary teeth?</strong><br>A. As soon as the first tooth erupts, primary teeth may be cleaned with a clean, wet wash cloth or wet gauze. The gums should also be gently wiped. If a toothbrush is used, it should be an appropriate size.<br><br><strong>Q. Where does decay on the primary teeth occur most often?</strong><br>A. With inappropriate or prolonged use of the baby bottle, decay may occur on the upper front teeth (incisors). The second most-often occurring site are the upper primary molars, which are found furthest back in the mouth. If there is no spacing between the primary teeth, there is a much greater chance of decay between the primary molars. These teeth should be flossed as soon as they come in.<br><br><strong>Q. Why are dental sealants beneficial for children?</strong><br>A. Dental sealants are applied by your dentist as protective coatings for the chewing surface of permanent molars. They protect the teeth from decay. Read on for more information.<br><br><strong>Q. What is a dental implant?</strong><br>A. A dental implant is a permanent artificial tooth replacement.<br><br><strong>Q. What is the procedure for receiving dental implants?</strong><br>A. <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalimplants.com/">Dental implants</a> are inserted surgically in two steps. The first step is to insert a “post” into or onto the jawbone. This post will then become the “anchor” for the artificial tooth that will be placed over the “post”.<br><br><strong>Q. How long is the procedure for dental implants?</strong><br>A. Getting a dental implant is a two step process. Once the “post” is inserted into the jawbone, the patient will have between three and six months with a temporary restoration. During this period, the bone and gum area around the post will heal to create a strong and healthy bond.<br><br>Once this bond is complete, an additional set of smaller posts is attached to the original post and then the artificial tooth is secured to the posts. The entire procedure could take anywhere from three to ten months.<br><br><strong>Q. Can I eat regularly while the implants are bonding?</strong><br>A. While the “post” is bonding with your jaw and gums, your dentist will place a temporary artificial tooth on the post. During the bonding period, you will need to eat soft foods.<br><br><strong>Q. Do implants require special care?</strong><br>A. Yes and No. Dental implants need to be brushed, flossed and checked regularly by a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a>, just as you would do with your regular teeth. But dental implants don’t need special brushes or pastes.<br><br><strong>Q. Can you eat and chew normally with dental implants?</strong><br>A. Yes. Consider that natural teeth can absorb up to approximately 540 lbs. per square inch of biting pressure and properly placed dental implants can withstand up to approximately 450 lbs. per square inch of the same pressure.<br><br><strong>Q. How long should a dental implant last?</strong><br>A.

Here are some ways dentistry is taking oral care into the new millennium.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Air Abrasion:</strong> High-speed delivery of “blasting particles” to a decayed tooth can replace the drill in many cases. The fine stream of air and aluminum oxide provides dentists with a more precise tool for removing decay quickly, without damaging surrounding sections of the tooth. This exciting dental treatment is also a plus for patients because it normally doesn’t require any local anesthesia. While air abrasion may not be suitable for large areas of decay or the removal of silver fillings, it can be used to repair tiny cracks, remove stains, and smooth the tooth surface so that bonding materials adhere to the tooth.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Intra-oral Cameras:</strong> A tiny camera inserted into the patient’s mouth allows the dentist to show the patient the exact nature of the problem. The image is enlarged and sent to a monitor that the patient and doctor view together. When patients can see the specific area in need of treatment, they’re more likely to understand and accept the dentist’s recommendation.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Lasers:</strong> Research continues at a fast pace in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/121/laser-dentistry">laser dentistry</a>. Lasers have been used for years in a limited capacity, but their role in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stwisdomteeth.com/">oral surgery</a> is likely to increase.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Digitized X-rays:</strong> Computerized technology will allow a small sensor inside the patient’s mouth to take the X-ray and immediately display it on a computer screen, eliminating film and darkroom processing, and reducing the radiation exposure for the patient.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Computers:</strong> There is a growing recognition of the role that computers can play in dental care. In the future, patient records may be kept on computer disks, including visual images captured on intraoral cameras. A computerized workstation beside the patient’s chair will give the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a> the ability to view the patient’s history from disk. The dentist might also use a voice-recognition system to ask the computer to assist in finding that data, or generate a “before and after” image so the patient can preview the result of dental treatment before it is done.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>CD-ROM:</strong> Patient education will be a snap with information stored on CD-ROM. Procedures can be explained to patients in advance and post-operative instructions can be provided for them to take home.</span></li>

Gray, DDS, MAGD, FICO</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Seniors — Age Brings Changes In Dental Care Treatment</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">It’s an indisputable fact – our bodies change as we get older and so does our need for dentistry. These changes take different forms in different people, depending on our inherited physical traits, our lifestyle and nutritional habits, and our medical conditions.<br><br>Age brings changes in oral health and your need for dental care, too. There are some specific areas where seniors need to pay close attention to protect and extend their oral health.</span><ul><li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Tooth Color:</strong> Plaque is an invisible layer of bacteria that forms on our teeth, and can trap stains at any age. But as we get older, plaque builds up more quickly and is harder to remove. At the same time, the tissue that lies underneath the tooth enamel, called “dentin,” is changing, and those changes can make teeth appear darker. Finally, decades of consuming coffee, tea, or tobacco leave stains that build up over time.</span></li></ul><br><span class="font-size-m">Daily brushing and flossing are important, particularly first thing in the morning and just before bed, to combat the plaque that builds up overnight. You may also want to consult your dentist about using commercial rinses that remove plaque.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Dry Mouth:</strong> Many seniors experience a reduced flow of saliva, sometimes as a side effect of medications such as painkillers or decongestants. For some, the lack of moisture inside the mouth can lead to sore throats, a burning sensation, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing. In addition, if you leave dry mouth unattended, it can damage teeth, since saliva’s natural rinsing keeps bacteria washed away from teeth and gums. Sugar-free chewing gum and hard candy will stimulate natural saliva, and artificial saliva and oral rinses will provide much-needed relief. Ask your dentist which commercial products are the best for you.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Cavities:</strong> If your gums begin to recede, the portion of the tooth that used to be below the gum line is now exposed. Roots are softer than tooth surfaces and are susceptible to decay; they are also likely to be sensitive to hot and cold beverages and food. Most people over age 50 suffer from some form of dental care disease. Make sure you take good care of teeth and gums with daily brushing and flossing. A word of caution: your gums may be starting to thin. Brush thoroughly but gently to keep from tearing your gums.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Fillings:</strong> Your fillings are getting older, too. They can weaken or crack, or your tooth may decay around the edges of the filling. As a result, bacteria can seep into your tooth, causing more decay. Regular check-ups will give your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a> the chance to keep an eye on your existing fillings.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Gum Disease:</strong> Daily cleaning and good nutrition are critical for healthy gums. When gums become infected and diseased, they set off a chain reaction that can result in losing teeth or weakening the jawbone. Either condition creates more problems for your health and increases your medical costs. Contact your dentist if your gums become red or you have <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stgumdisease.com/">bleeding gums</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Good Nutrition:</strong> What you put into your mouth has a direct impact on the health of your mouth — and the health of the rest of your body. As you age and your lifestyle changes, keep your nutritional goals in mind. Balanced meals are one the best ways you can contribute to your own good health.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Regular Exams:</strong> The dentist will check your mouth, teeth, and jaw for any problems. You should also mention any sores, swelling, or pain you might be experiencing or if you have <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/1068/diabetes">diabetes</a> or other medicat conditions. Regular checkups enable the dentist to spot problems early. Early resolution of problems will help you keep your natural teeth.</span></li>

Another type of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stcosmeticdentist.com/">tooth-colored dental fillings</a> used in dental care are called a resin ionomer, which releases fluoride useful for preventing tooth decay.<br>Besides Their Cosmetic Value, What Other Benefits Do Composites Provide in dental care.<br><br>The bonding process used in restoration provides strength to the tooth, making it more structurally sound. It also seals the tooth, decreasing the chance of sensitivity to hot and cold. Some composites made with materials releasing fluoride are ideal for treating root decay, a condition when gums recede, exposing tooth roots to more cavity-causing plaque. These fluoride-releasing materials also are useful dental fillings for decayed baby teeth.<br><br><strong>What Is the Process for Dental Care Treatment?</strong><br>Following removal of the decayed area, a mild acid solution is used to prepare the tooth’s surface for bonding and dental fillings. A bonding agent is then brushed over the surface. Several layers of the composite are applied during the next dental care process.

Early detection can make a dramatic difference in treating the cancer at curable stages and reducing <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/438/oral-health">oral cancer</a> deaths.<br><br>Early detection capabilities recently have been enhanced by a new computer-assisted mouth cancer screening tool. A nationwide study of 945 patients ranging in ages from 18 to 83 was conducted by dentists at 35 U.S. academic dental care sites.<br>Brush biopsy specimens were obtained from oral lesions as part of the extensive research, testing the accuracy of computer-assisted diagnostic equipment. The brush biopsy caused little or no bleeding and no anesthetic was required. The computer-assisted image analysis was used to identify suspicious cells in the samples.<br><br>The computer analysis properly identified every case of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions as confirmed by lab tests from their traditional tissue evaluations. Additionally, it also correctly identified some lesions that were benign in appearance, but were actually found to be pre-cancerous or cancerous. Had it not been for this new diagnostic equipment, these lesions would have escaped detection and the patient would not have received any additional oral cancer testing.<br><br>“Early evaluation of oral pre-cancerous lesions can have a dramatic impact on oral cancer mortality rates,” says Dr. James J. Sciubba, DMD, PhD, professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology at State University of New York at Stony Brook, who also serves as a spokesperson for the study.

Then he charged a pistol with this bullet and a full measure of powder. The firing performed a speedy and effectual removal of the offending tooth” (Dr. Monsey, 1788).<br><br>In the US and Europe, the blacksmith did extractions, presumably because they had the “proper tools.”<br>“If one had a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stwisdomteeth.com/">tooth extracted</a>, it must be burned, because, if a dog got it and swallowed it, one would have a dog’s tooth come in its place” (Dr. Holmes, 1862).<br><br><strong>Tooth Cleaning</strong><br>To clean the teeth, rub them with the ashes of burnt bread (Poor Will’s Almanack, 1780).<br><br>To stable and steadfast the teeth, and to keep the gummes in good case, it shall be very good every day in the morning to wash well the mouth with red wine (London, 1598).<br><br>In parts of England, the superstition persists: one prevents a toothache by “clothing one’s right leg prior to the left” (G.P.

When experiencing pain and/or swelling, it is important to see your dentist to have the area evaluated. The pain and/or swelling is most often related to a disease process that originates within a particular tooth.<br><br>The pulpal tissue within the tooth can be irritated by bacteria, external traumatic events, repetitive or extensive dental care procedures, or even periodontal disease causing a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/1071/tooth-root-sensitivity">toothache</a>. When this irritation occurs, the pulpal tissue reacts by becoming inflamed.<br><br>Since the pulpal tissues and the tissues supporting the tooth have a rich supply of nerve fibers, the inflammatory process can cause pain as these nerve pathways are stimulated. Additionally, the pulp tissue is encased inside tooth structure and it cannot swell and expand in reaction to injury like tissues in other areas of the body.<br><br>When the injured pulp tissue attempts to swell within the confined <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1strootcanal.com/">root canal</a> space, the pressure buildup can cause a significant toothache.<br><br>Pain originating from the dental pulp can be either “spontaneous” or “elicited.” Spontaneous pain occurs without an identifiable stimulus, whereas elicited pain occurs only in specific situations. Elicited pain requires a specific stimulus such as drinking cold or hot fluids or biting on the tooth.<br><br>As is typical anywhere in the body, the initial stages of a disease process do not always cause symptoms. Millions of teeth have irreversible pulpal disease yet the patients have no clinical symptoms.<br><br>Most of these situations will become evident when the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a> obtains a thorough history, does a clinical examination, performs specific tooth tests, and takes a series of well-angulated radiographs. It is important to note that pulpal disease can refer pain to other areas within the head and neck.<br><br>If the results of the endodontic examination indicate that root canal disease is not the source of the patient’s toothache, then the dentist must consider other possibilities. When attempting to identify the source or cause of facial pain and/or swelling, the dentist must consider that the symptoms could actually originate in a tooth (endodontic disease), the gum tissues (periodontal disease), the muscles (myofacial pain), the joints (TMJ), the sinuses (sinusitis), or even the surrounding vascular (blood vessels) or nerve tissues.<br><br>Facial pain requires an accurate diagnosis so that the proper treatment can be recommended.

It may be as simple as the need to pay more attention to your daily oral hygiene, or it may indicate tooth decay, <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stgumdisease.com/">gum disease</a>, or another medical or dental health problem. Whichever it is, bad breath is a red flag: take another look at your mouth!<br><br>Commercial products claim they will make your breath fresher, but the only way to make sure your breath permanently fresh is to practice good oral hygiene. In fact, too many breath mints and hard candies with sugar will lead to tooth decay. If you are constantly using breath mints, breath sprays, or mouthrinses in an effort to cover up your bad breath, realize that you may have a medical or dental care problem that needs addressing.<br><br>There are a number of reasons you may experience a bad taste in your mouth, and even be able to smell your own breath. Food may be lodged between your teeth if you are not brushing at least twice daily and flossing regularly. Food particles can be very tiny and can wedge themselves between teeth and below the gum line.<br><br>Brushing after meals is important and flossing is imperative to get at the particles that the brush can’t reach. Brush your tongue or use a tongue scraper, even if it feels odd at first. Bacteria collects on the tongue and can contribute to bad breath. If you wear removable dentures, take them out at night and clean them thoroughly before you wear them again.<br><br>If you neglect your daily hygiene over time, bad breath can become a symptom of more serious dental health problems. Teeth that are not cleaned properly become a place for bacteria to reside as food particles stay in your mouth and decay. Bacteria attack your teeth and gums and cause cavities and gum disease. If this is happening, gum disease will cause an unpleasant odor.<br><br>If you are brushing and flossing on a regular basis, but are still experiencing bad breath, you may have teeth that are crooked or crowded, and it may be hard for you to clean between them. If you wear dentures that do not fit properly, they may be trapping food or irritating your mouth. Your bad breath is may be caused by another medical problem: drainage from your sinuses, gastrointestinal problems, kidney or liver problems, or other medical conditions.<br><br>Here’s what you can do to investigate on your own. Write down what you’re eating and notice whether your breath smells bad because of certain foods. Garlic and onions actually cause odor, but the odor is coming from your lungs as you breathe, not from your mouth itself. The odor from these foods is temporary, and will be gone once the food is out of your bloodstream.<br><br>Are you dieting? Hunger can contribute to bad breath, because of the chemical changes as your body turns fat and protein into the energy it needs. Are you taking prescription or over-the-counter medications? Add these to the record of what you’re eating to see whether there’s a relationship between your medications and your bad breath. And don’t forget to tell your dentist if there’s been a change in your overall health since your last visit.<br><br>Are you suffering from dry mouth? Saliva provides constant rinsing in your mouth and washes away food particles. Your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalfinancing.com/a/1081/dental-care-for-seniors">dentist</a> may recommend more liquids, or sugarless candy to stimulate natural saliva, and perhaps some of the commercial products that are available to combat dry mouth.<br><br>If bad breath continues after you have done your best job of regular brushing and flossing, go see your dental care professional. He or she can tell you whether the odor is caused by an oral problem; if it is not, then your dentist will suggest you see your doctor for a physical check-up.<br><br>Regular dental check-ups with a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentistry</a> professional will help keep your mouth healthy and working well.

Loss of attachment or bone support around a tooth is the result of a bacterial infection. What is true is that as we get older, we have more exposures to these infectious organisms, and more probability of being infected and developing periodontal disease. Half of the people over 55 have periodontal disease.<br><br>Risk factors that make older adults more susceptible to periodontal disease include:<br><strong>Systemic diseases</strong>: Certain systemic diseases such as diabetes may decrease the body’s ability to fight infection and can result in more severe periodontal disease. Osteoporosis also can increase the amount and rate of bone loss around teeth. Systemic illnesses will affect periodontal disease if it is a pre-existing condition. To reduce the effects of systemic diseases on the oral cavity, maintain meticulous plaque control and visit your dental care provider routinely for examinations and professional cleanings.<br><br><strong>Medications</strong>: Heart medications can have a direct effect on the gums by creating an exaggerated response to plaque and resulting in gum overgrowth.

Using the old dentistry, dentists did their best to provide a high quality of service given the state of knowledge and technology at that time.<br>Through advancements in treatment, research, and the desire of the dental profession to do more and do it better, the new dentistry has emerged. It is based on a foundation with specific characteristics that are of great benefit to us as consumers.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Efficiency: Your time and your resources are valuable to you, and your dentist recognizes this. New dentistry treatment techniques and methods have considerably reduced the amount of time that the dental care now takes. The return on your investment in dental health is excellent.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Comfort: Not only are the dental chairs and the dentistry office environments more comfortable and pleasant, improvements in the use of local anesthetics and new equipment provide more comfort than ever before.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Collaboration: The dental relationship is now based on the value that you can derive from your dentistry team and what you want for your dental future rather than just on the techniques and procedures your dentist can do. Through continuing education, your dentist has the skills and knowledge to help you make decisions for your dental health in a positive and informed way.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Predictability: New materials and advances in treatment provide you with opportunities to maintain your dental health throughout your life. With the innovative cosmetic and specialized dentistry approaches to reclaiming teeth that formally would be lost, your dentistry professional can help create and maintain teeth and gums. Predictable treatment, effective prevention methods, and the longevity of treatment are now part of any dental plan.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Thoroughness: Advances in assessment and diagnosis now enable <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentists</a> to make thorough evaluations of your overall dental and oral health. The outcome is a plan for your health that will give you peace of mind, knowing you can have a well-informed dental plan in place.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Prevention: This characteristic of the new dentistry has received much publicity in recent years. It has been proven over and over again that there are several measures that you can take as a consumer of dental care to create and maintain your dental health in collaboration with your dental team. It bears repeating again — flossing and brushing combined with regular <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">dental hygiene</a> checks are your greatest allies in maintaining your teeth and a bright smile.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Precision: The new dentistry utilizes instruments and technologies that are far advanced from what was available even 15 years ago. Both general dentists and specialists have access to technologies that provide precision in diagnosis and treatment. The value for you is higher quality care.</span></li>

What is endodontics?</strong><br>A. <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/a/1080/root-canal">Endodontics</a> is the area of dentistry that specifically deals with what is called the pulp within a tooth.<br><br><strong>Q. What is dental pulp?</strong><br>A. The dental pulp is a soft tissue comprised of tiny arteries, veins, nerves and lymph vessels for the tooth.<br><br><strong>Q. Where does the term root canal come from?</strong><br>A. The tooth is comprised of three basic components. The first component is the crown/enamel, which is seen by the naked eye.<br><br>The next level of the tooth is dentin, which is under the enamel and the “housing” for the dental pulp. The final component is the dental pulp and is the core of the tooth. This bulk of the dental pulp is in the center of the tooth or the pulp chamber, and is connected to the Mandibular Canal through the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1strootcanal.com/">root canals</a>. The root canals are like veins for the dental pulp.<br><br><strong>Q. What does the procedure root canal mean?</strong><br>A. Root canal has become a term for a procedure involving the dental pulp. When the dental pulp has been exposed and damaged, it must be treated professionally and this process is usually referred to as getting a root canal.<br><br><strong>Q. What does a root canal procedure entail?</strong><br>A. Once the dental pulp has been infected, it must be removed from both the pulp chamber and the root canals. Once it has been removed, the pulp chamber and root canals are thoroughly cleaned and enlarged. Based on the level of infection, the dentists may choose to clean the area more than once. After the area is free of infection, the dentist will fill the root canals and pulp chamber with a filling that will prevent any bacteria from entering the area. Finally, the dentist will place a crown over the tooth to restore it to its original shape.<br><br><strong>Q. What causes dental pulp to become damaged or infected?</strong><br>A. Normally, when a deep cavity occurs, it exposes the dental pulp to the bacteria inside the mouth. When exposed to this bacteria, the dental pulp can become infected and thus cause the inside of the tooth to be infected.<br><br><strong>Q. What can happen if infected dental pulp is not treated?</strong><br>A. Overtime, the infected pulp will die. At the same time, pus from the infection will develop at the base of the tooth and cause an abscess to form. If this occurs, it is not uncommon for the abscess to cause the bone holding the tooth to deteriorate. If this deterioration becomes too severe, the tooth will fall out.<br><br><strong>Q. What role does the computer play in the dental care industry?</strong><br>A. In the future, patient records may be kept on computer disks, including visual images captured on intraoral cameras. A computerized workstation beside the patient’s chair will give the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a> the ability to view the patient’s history from disk.<br>Also, the dentist might use a voice-recognition system to ask the computer to assist in finding that data, or create a “before and after” image so the patient can preview the result of dental work before it is done.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Sterilization of Dental Equipment</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">The times are trying enough without having to worry about a visit to the dentist.

That’s normal, and should go away after a few days. If it doesn’t, the problem may lie elsewhere. And we want to know about it.<br><br>There’s also pain from “root surface sensitivity.” This can result from years of brushing teeth too hard, “heartburn acid” which enters the mouth overnight and attacks the enamel of your teeth, receding gums, or <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stgumdisease.com/">periodontal pockets</a> of infection.

Regular examinations by a dentistry professional are crucial to maintaining your dental health and are a necessity in any dental care plan.<br><br>Dentists begin the dental examination with a complete dental and medical history, including medications the patient is currently taking. The skin of the face and neck is examined for any abnormalities, especially pigment changes. The lymph nodes in front and behind the ears, under the floor of the mouth and chin, and the midline of the neck, sides, and back of the neck are palpated to determine if any swelling or tenderness is present.<br><br>Inside of the mouth, the lips, cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth are inspected and palpated.

Although often referred to as “Novocain,” this once popular painkilling drug has actually been replaced by more effective anesthetics such as Lidocaine for a commfortable dental care treatment. It also works very well for temporary relief of a tooth ache.<br>However, the name has become so much a part of the American vocabulary, it’s now used in generic terms. Prior to injecting the local anesthetic, the dentist often swabs a topical anesthetic over the injection site to prevent the patient from even feeling the needle.<br><br><strong>Conscious Sedation Dentistry:</strong><br>Patients seeking comfortable dentistry can consult with their dentists to choose anti-anxiety agents either administered by mouth, inhalation or injection. Nitrous oxide, often referred to as <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stsedationdentist.com/a/195/nitrous-oxide-sedation">laughing gas</a>, helps to ease patient anxiety. The gas is inhaled by patients, inducing relaxation, so they can approach dental procedures with less stress.<br><br><strong>Deep Sedation:</strong><br>This may be required for complex procedures or for dental patients with special needs. With the administration of general anesthesia, the patient is unconscious; with deep sedation dentistry or sleep dentistry, dental patients are deeply relaxed and not fully aware of their surroundings during their dental treatment.<br><br><strong>Consult With Your Dentist</strong><br>Prior to treatment, your dentist will need to know a few things regarding your health history such as:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">allergies</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">your current health condition</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">any medications you may be taking.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">Some medicines may interfere with the efficiency of an anesthetic requiring an adjustment in your medication schedule. Your health history is very important information for the dentist. During the consultation, you can ask questions about any dental procedures that may be of concern during your dental procedure.<br><br><strong>A Concern for Safety</strong><br>The drugs used as dental anesthetics are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are safe. Anesthetic providers are professionals with a commitment to patient safety and comfort.<br>A dental anesthetic can be administered by a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">general dentist</a>, a dental anesthesiologist or an M.D. Certification is required and is regulated on a state-by-state basis.

A sedation dentist and conscious sedation dentistry makes it possible to be totally relaxed during your dental treatment.<br>You won’t feel any discomfort and likely won’t remember the treatment itself. Because you’ll be completely comfortable, your sedation dentist can do many dental care procedures during the same visit, including:</span><ul>

Then there are those who have a very strong gag reflex, and going to the dentist is a real ordeal. Or maybe extensive care is needed and there simply aren’t enough hours in the day to accomplish it.<br><br>It’s time to rest easy. Sedation dentistry is here.<br>After an initial consultation, your dentist will give you a dental anesthesia to take, it’s called Triazolam, before your visit. You must bring a friend along to get you home after your appointment. At your appointment, you’ll be drowsy, but thoroughly responsive (conscious sedation). The sedation dentistry team will monitor your every move throughout. The big plus: Most patients don’t feel anything, and all your dentistry needs can be accomplished at one time, sometimes in as little as two to six hours, from straightforward care to the most complicated.<br><br>For anxious patients, this new treatment is a kind of miracle, a boon to dental health.

History has repeatedly shown us that people will journey to the far ends of the earth for ways to improve and maintain a youthful appearance – whether it is in search of the fountain of youth or to find a plastic surgeon or cosmetic dentist to surgically enhance their facial structures. Plastic surgeons have been instrumental in making facelifts and other related procedures more common to the mainstream population. As a result, a paradigm shift has occurred in how we view ourselves as we get older.<br><br><strong>Dentists can now use </strong><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1sttoothwhitening.com/">laser tooth whitening</a></strong><strong> to whiten teeth.</strong><br>The shift has made the average person more knowledgeable of the link between lifestyle and appearance. Consequently, people are changing their habits, attitudes and preconceived perceptions of aging.<br><br>More than ever, people are more willing to dedicate the resources necessary to find the balance between their image, spirituality and life choices. In response to the shift in people’s thought processes, the medical community has developed newer and more predictable anti-aging techniques to slow the affect of aging on the human body.<br><br>With a large segment of the population reaching the significant milestone of 50, the increase in appearance-enhancement therapies will continue to rise significantly in coming years.<br><br>Everyone knows that if you want to cheat the aging process, the person you go to for help is a plastic surgeon. However, if you only consider a surgeon for help, you could leave out an integral part of the rejuvenation equation.

Your body is the canvas or clay, your face and bone structure are the frame, and at the center of the painting is your smile. In order to make masterpieces appear life-like, artisans must have an understanding of general anatomy and bone structure.<br><br>Equating those concepts to aging, you can say that your youthful appearance is as dependent upon how much support you have for your soft tissues. The old adage “Beauty is only skin deep” does not apply to plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry. Time has a way of shrinking the underlying bone and teeth. If surgeons and cosmetic dentists do not restore what is lost, they will not be able to achieve a natural look.<br>Using cheek and chin implants in conjunction with facelifts are just some of the ways surgeons restore facial support and beauty. <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stcosmeticdentist.com/">Cosmetic dentists</a> use laser tooth whitening, bonding and porcelain veneers to create a more youthful smile.<br><br>By Benjamin O.

Gray, DDS, MAGD, FICO</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Tooth Bleaching Before Dental Crowns from Your Dentist</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">If you require crowns to be placed, it is a good idea to evaluate how you feel about the color of your existing teeth before beginning the process. If you like the color of your teeth, the dentist will then match the crowns to that color. On the other hand, if you feel you would like to whiten or lighten your teeth, it is a good idea to communicate this to your dentist beforehand about <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1sttoothwhitening.com/">tooth whitening</a>. Once the final restorations are made, it will not be possible to change their color without redoing them.<br><br><strong>At-Home Teeth Bleaching</strong><br>If you desire whiter teeth before the crowns are placed, the best way to achieve this is to talk to your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentist</a> about at-home teeth whitening. With this procedure, custom-fitted plastic trays will be made for your teeth and you will be given some small tubes of dental bleaching material. Your dentist will show you how to place a small amount of bleaching material in the tray and then place the tray in your mouth. The tray is then worn for one to two hours in the evening, depending on the type of material. The biggest advantage of this method of teeth whitening compared to procedures that are done in your dentist’s office is, that you are the one who can control how white your teeth will be. Since you are the one in control, you can stop bleaching whenever you feel you have achieved the desired color. The typical bleaching time is one and one-half to two weeks, but it may be longer.<br><br><strong>Sensitivity to Tooth Bleaching</strong><br>Your teeth may become sensitive to cold air or liquids during the tooth bleaching process. This is normal and will subside and finally go away when you stop bleaching. There are a couple of things you can do to decrease this sensitivity if it arises during the tooth whitening process. One is to only bleach every other night. The other is to have your dentist prescribe for you a fluoride gel that you can place in your custom bleach trays every other evening. The fluoride acts to decrease the sensitivity by coating or sealing the tooth surface. It will not affect the color of your teeth. This is the most reliable way to decrease sensitivity while you bleach. Once you get your teeth to the desired color, your dentist will have you wait about three to four weeks before taking a color match of your new white teeth in order to make the final restoration. During this time, the color of your teeth will be stabilizing.<br><br><strong>Once the Restorations Are Placed, What Can You Expect?</strong><br>Teeth bleaching is a very predictable method for getting <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1sttoothwhitening.com/a/162/white-teeth">white teeth</a>, but the results will not last forever. Since the restorations were placed when your teeth were at their whitest, you will most likely find that in one and a half to two years, the restorations may begin to appear lighter than your natural teeth. This result is to be expected. It is not caused by a change in color of the restorations, but rather by your own teeth getting darker. At this point, all that is required is to, once again, bleach your natural teeth until the color is evened out. Usually, this only requires bleaching a couple of times. After the color is evened out, you can then expect to have the color stability last for another one and a half to two years.<br><br>By Greggory Kinzer, DDS, MSD</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Tooth Whitening – Why Are My Teeth Discolored?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">If you’re embarrassed by your discolored teeth, you’re not alone.

While it would be nice to get the smile you’d love naturally, that just isn’t an option. So, who’s to blame? Why are you struggling with tooth discoloration to begin with? Good news – it may not be your fault!<br><br><strong>Common Causes of Tooth Discoloration</strong><br>There are a number of causes of potential tooth discoloration, and some are completely unavoidable on your part. While the precise cause of your tooth discoloration may be difficult to peg down, chances are one or more of the following causes are to blame.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Food and Drinks.</strong> You may have heard that coffee, tea and soda can stain your teeth, but did you know certain veggies, like potatoes and apples, can stain them as well?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Tobacco.</strong> This is a given. Smoking and chewing will not only discolor your teeth, but can also cause gum disease or contribute to oral cancer (among other health conditions).</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Poor Dental Hygiene.</strong> If you don’t want to give up your morning coffee or kick your smoking habit, then you’re going to have to try to compensate with excellent dental care. Regular brushing and flossing can reduce the odds that you will stain your teeth. Regular check ups and cleanings are critical, too.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Disease.</strong> Ahh… finally, we’re discussing possible causes for tooth discoloration that aren’t your fault. Several diseases that affect tooth enamel and dentin can lead to tooth discoloration. What’s more, treatments for certain conditions, such as chemotherapy to fight cancer, can discolor your teeth. If you’re pregnant while suffering from one of these ailments or undergoing one of these treatments, the teeth of your developing child may be affected as well.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Medications.</strong> Certain antibiotics, such as tetracycline and doxycycline, can discolor your teeth, particularly if used before the age of 8. Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride can also stain teeth, while antihistamines (like Benadryl), antipsychotic drugs and antihypertensive medications also cause discoloration.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Genetics.</strong> When all else fails, blame mom and dad.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Age.</strong> Nothing escapes the affects of age – not even your teeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Environment.</strong> Excessive fluoride from environmental sources, such as naturally high fluoride levels in the water, can contribute to discolored teeth.</span></li>

In this respect, it’s one of the most conservative cosmetic procedures.

A heat source “cures” the bleach and hastens the process. These steps are repeated several times, depending on the appropriate level of whiteness you want to achieve. The color of adjacent teeth will be considered too, so you’ll look natural (there is such a thing as too white).<br>A professional tooth whitening session takes 30 to 45 minutes – and there you are. After three to five sessions, the tooth really shows the difference.<br><br><strong>Does professional tooth bleaching work for everyone?</strong><br>The success of the procedure depends in part on what caused the tooth staining in the first place. Surface coffee, tea, and tobacco stains that resist cleaning can be bleached away (the stains will reappear over time if you continue to indulge, of course). Antibiotic staining – from tetracycline, for example – is a bit harder to treat with simple teeth bleaching. Alternatively, a jacket or <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stcosmeticdentist.com/">porcelain veneers</a> may be called for.

Each patient and tooth presents a different set of circumstances. Generally the cost of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1strootcanal.com/">root canal</a> treatment is directly related to the chair time necessary to perform the treatment as well as to the costs of the dentist staff, training, and technology that the dentist has available when performing the procedure. Be sure to ask your dentist about <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.powaycosmeticdentist.com/articles/369/1stdentalfinancing.com">dental financing</a> credit, dental treatment financing, or if there is a possible loan for dental work available.<br><br>There are many factors that influence the amount of chair time necessary to treat any particular tooth:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">The position of the tooth in the mouth.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">The number of roots and the number of canals within these roots.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Root curvatures and the length of the roots.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">The presence or absence of calcifications within the root canal space.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Special dental considerations. For example, it may be more difficult for the dentist to work through an existing crown or a bridge than to work on a tooth with only a small previous filling. Also, some teeth may have been severely broken down by past dental disease and these may have to be “built-up” before root canal treatment can even be started so that an aseptic field can be established and maintained during treatment.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">In addition to the chair time involved for treatment, other factors are also taken into consideration when determining a fair fee for root canal treatment:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">The cost of technology. Dentists who use state-of-the-art technology for certain procedures have invested in microscopes, computer digital radiography, ultrasonics, and specialized training courses for themselves and for their staff. The costs of these items are shared by those patients who benefit from them.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">The costs of the dental office overhead include staff, rent, and supplies in addition to many other expenses. These costs vary significantly in different areas of the country.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Fees vary among practitioners due to differences in their endodontic treatment philosophies, which in turn dictate the chair time required, the materials selected, and the technologies utilized.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">In conclusion, there can be marked discrepancies in the fees charged for root canal treatment by different dentists. Ultimately, the best value for care is treatment that is done once and works over a period of many years. Conversely, the most expensive dental treatment is the treatment that may cost less initially but does not work predictably and needs to be redone one or more times. The wise dental consumer does not make a treatment decision on the basis of cost alone.<br><br><strong>Will Insurance Cover the Cost of Root Canal Treatment?</strong><br>Dental insurance will usually help with a portion of the endodontic treatment fee. A variety of dental insurance plans are available. A specific benefit package is selected contractually by each employer for the benefit of the employees. Some benefit packages may restrict or not recognize certain procedures, while in other instances the yearly maximums are unrealistic for anything other than the most basic care. The dentist will make a professional judgment and treatment recommendation based on what is best for the patient, not on what is best for the for-profit insurance company. The total fee is the patient’s responsibility but the dental office will work with the insurance carrier to get the maximum contracted benefit. The patient should speak with the dental treatment coordinator before treatment begins in an attempt to estimate the available insurance benefit.  Be sure to ask your dentist about patient financing, dental treatment financing, dental credit cards, or if there is a possible loan for dental work available.<br><br>by Clifford J.

Many patients don’t have any dental insurance at all. Some patients have excellent dental insurance policies or <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalfinancing.com/a/366/dental-credit">dental credit</a>, some have fair policies, and some have poor policies. Many plans tell you you’ll be covered up to 80% – 100%. In spite of what you’re told, most plans cover only 15% – 70% of the average dental fee plan. We realize that every bit of help you get from your insurance company is a big help, and we are glad you have coverage. However, it must be understood that how much your policy covers has already been determined by how much your employer paid for your insurance policy. The less he/she paid for the insurance, the less you’ll receive.<br><br>FOR EXAMPLE: PLAN Costs a lot of money Costs 1/2 the amount Deductible is $50.00 Deductible is $100.00 Pays $84.00 on a filling Pays $35.00 on a filling Yearly maximum is $1,000 Yearly maximum is $800 It has been the experience of many dentists that some insurance companies tell their customers that “fees are above the usual and customary” rather than saying “our benefits are low.”<br><br>Your insurance company sets the “allowables” or “a usual and customary dental fee plan” depending on how much your employer paid for your policy. It’s just like your car insurance. The lower the benefits you choose, the less it costs you in premiums. Many necessary routine dentistry services are not covered by dental insurance at all.

What is the new technology dentists are using that reduces or eliminates discomfort from shots given during a dental procedure</strong><br>A. A computerized injection system called <em>The Wand</em> has been shown to significantly reduce patient discomfort in delivering oral anesthetics. In a study of patients who have had procedures using it, more than 80% of them reported that it was a completely painless process. Consult your dentist to see if this dental procedure is covered by your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.powaycosmeticdentist.com/articles/368/1stdentalfinancing.com">dental care payment plan</a>.<br><br>A very thin needle is attached to a pen-sized wand and placed near the gums. A drop of anesthetic numbs the gum before the needle is inserted. There is no prick or burning sensation with this system. As the needle glides through the gum, the anesthetic continues to be released. When the needle is fully inserted, the computer slowly releases the anesthetic. This eliminates the usual cause of the discomfort of the traditional dental shot — the pressure associated with the stream of anesthetic flowing into the gum.<br><br><strong>Q. How can early tooth decay be detected?</strong><br>A. A dentist can put a “caries detection dye” on a suspicious tooth. This colored liquid helps identify the position and the extent of decay that is not visible to the naked eye. The dental procedure price may very.<br><br><strong>Q. Are there any new prevention treatments for reducing tooth decay?</strong><br>A. New prevention treatments are being studied. Research has shown that a tooth-decay inhibiting treatment can effectively eliminate the bacteria that cause tooth decay in humans. One promising treatment still in development is a caries vaccine, CaroRX, a tasteless, colorless antibody from genetically-altered plants, which is painted on clean teeth to prevent decay-causing bacteria from sticking to teeth. Planet Biotechnology, the manufacturer of CaroRX, hopes to gain FDA approval and make this product available to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentists</a> within the next few years.<br><br><strong>Q. What are intraoral cameras?</strong><br>A. An intraoral camera is a miniature video camera that the dentist places in the patient’s mouth so that together they can view any dental problems that the patient is having. The image from the camera is enlarged and sent to a monitor for viewing.<br><br><strong>Q. What is the purpose of intraoral cameras?</strong><br>A. The purpose behind intraoral cameras is to allow the patient to see the specific area that needs treatment so that they are more likely to understand the dentist’s recommendation and accept it.

Using the old dentistry, dental professionals did their best to provide a high quality of service given the state of knowledge and technology at that time. Through advancements in treatment, research, and the desire of the dental profession to do more and do it better, the new dentistry has emerged. It is based on a foundation with specific characteristics that are of great benefit to us as consumers.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Efficiency: Your time and your resources are valuable to you, and your dental professional recognizes this. New treatment techniques and methods have considerably reduced the amount of time that the dental care now takes. The return on your investment in dental health is excellent.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Comfort: Not only are the dental chairs and the office environments more comfortable and pleasant, improvements in the use of local anesthetics and new equipment provide more comfort than ever before.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Collaboration: The dental relationship is now based on the value that you can derive from your dental team and what you want for your dental future rather than just on the techniques and procedures your dentist can do. Through continuing education, your dentist has the skills and knowledge to help you make decisions for your dental health in a positive and informed way.</span></li>

Predictable treatment, effective prevention methods, and the longevity of treatment are now part of any treatment plan.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Thoroughness: Advances in assessment and diagnosis now enable dentists to make thorough evaluations of your overall dental and oral health. The outcome is a plan for your health that will give you peace of mind, knowing you can have a well-informed <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.powaycosmeticdentist.com/articles/367/1stdentalfinancing.com">dental plan</a>in place.</span></li>

It has been proven over and over again that there are several measures that you can take as a consumer of dental care to create and maintain your dental health in collaboration with your dental team. It bears repeating again – flossing and brushing combined with regular dental hygiene checks are your greatest allies in maintaining your teeth and a bright smile.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Precision: The new dentistry utilizes instruments and technologies that are far advanced from what was available even 15 years ago.

Dealing With Sensitive Smiles</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Are you overly sensitive? Relax, it has nothing to do with crying during life insurance commercials. Millions of adults struggle with hypersensitive teeth, which means they are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, very sugary or acidic foods and drinks and vigorous toothbrushing. This kind of sensitivity is often called “dentin hypersensitivity.”<br><br>Dentin is the tissue that makes up the core of each tooth. Above the gumline, dentin is protected with a coating of enamel. Unfortunately, as enamel is worn away or decayed, dentin becomes exposed and receptive to sensations that cause painful nerve responses. This can also occur as the result of receding gums, a common symptom of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stgumdisease.com/">gum disease</a>.<br><br>So, what causes sensitive teeth? A number of things may be to blame. Over-zealous brushing with a firm bristled tooth brush or abrasive toothpaste can lead to dentin hypersensitivity, as can gum disease, which is the result of poor brushing and flossing habits. Your diet may also play a role, as frequent consumption of acidic foods and drinks can chemically dissolve tooth enamel. Finally, abnormal wear on tooth surfaces from chronic clenching or grinding of teeth, nail biting and chewing on hard objects can lead to sensitive teeth. To avoid the problem, brush and floss daily to maintain healthy gums and protect dentin from exposure. Avoid vigorous <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/a/377/tooth-cleaning">toothbrushing</a> with a hard-bristled toothbrush.<br><br>If you’re already suffering from overly sensitive teeth, your best bet is to contact your dentist for guidance on <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">dental hygiene</a>. In the mean time, there are products that can help. Desensitizing toothpaste used in conjunction with a soft-bristled toothbrush can help. Toothpaste designed for those with sensitive teeth can reduce the pain associated with the condition after only a few days of use.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Choosing Dental Health, Three Reasons Why It Is a Wise Choice for Care</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Most of us think that taking care of our teeth is about having a great smile and avoiding the discomfort of a toothache.

Whichever it is, bad breath is a red flag: take another look at your mouth!<br>Bad breath is a social problem; if you have bad breath, you may notice that people actually back away as you talk to them. Mouth odors are embarrassing, and they tell other people that you aren’t taking care of yourself.<br><br>Sometimes people are not aware that their breath smells bad; be alert to how other people react when they’re close to you, and be grateful if a friend or family member lets you know about the problem.<br>Commercial products claim they will make your breath fresher, but the only way to make sure your breath permanently fresh is to practice good oral hygiene. In fact, eating too many breath mints and hard candies with sugar will lead to tooth decay. If you are constantly using breath mints, breath sprays, or mouth rinses in an effort to cover up your bad breath, you may have a dental or medical problem that needs addressing.<br><br>There are a number of reasons you may experience a bad taste in your mouth, and even be able to smell your own breath. Food may be lodged between your teeth if you are not brushing at least twice daily and flossing regularly.<br><br>Food particles can be very tiny and can wedge themselves between teeth and below the gum line; brushing after meals is important and flossing is imperative to get at the particles that the brush can’t reach. Also, you must brush your tongue or use a tongue scraper.<br><br>As odd as it will feel at first, bacteria collects on the tongue and can contribute to bad breath.

Teeth that are not cleaned properly become a place for bacteria to reside as food particles stay in your mouth and decay. Bacteria attack your teeth and gums and cause cavities and gum disease. If this is happening, gum disease will cause an unpleasant odor.<br><br>Perhaps you are brushing and flossing on a regular basis, but are still experiencing bad breath. If you have teeth that are crooked or crowded, it may be hard for you to clean between them, and this can cause bad breath.<br><br>If you wear dentures that are not fitted properly, they may be trapping food or irritating your mouth. Or perhaps your bad breath is caused by another medical problem: drainage from your sinuses, gastrointestinal problems, kidney or liver problems, or other medical conditions.<br><br>&gt;Here’s what you can do to investigate on your own. Write down what you’re eating and notice whether your breath smells bad because of certain foods. Garlic and onions actually cause odor, but the odor is coming from your lungs as you breathe, not from your mouth itself. The odor from these foods is temporary, and will be gone once the food is out of your bloodstream.<br><br>Are you dieting? Hunger can contribute to bad breath, because of the chemical changes as your body turns fat and protein into the energy it needs. Are you taking prescription or over-the-counter medications? Add these to the record of what you’re eating to see whether there’s a relationship between your medications and your bad breath. And don’t forget to tell your dentist if there’s been a change in your overall health since your last visit.<br><br>Are you suffering from dry mouth? Saliva provides constant rinsing in your mouth and washes away food particles. Your dentist may recommend more liquids, and sugarless candy to stimulate natural saliva, and perhaps some of the commercial products that are available to combat dry mouth.<br><br>If bad breath continues after you have done your best job of regular brushing and flossing, start with your dentist or <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/a/1004/dental-hygentist">dental hygienist</a>.

Research has shown that poor nutrition jeopardizes our oral health which puts you at risk for a number of serious dental problems.<br><br><strong>The Food Factor</strong><br>Our food choices can make a big difference in two of the most common diseases today: tooth decay and gum disease. Certain foods, especially those containing sugar, are directly linked to increased levels of cavity-causing bacteria. Tooth decay results when acids from the bacteria attack the teeth forming cavities. While diet doesn’t directly cause gum disease, a condition affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth, researchers believe the disease is more rapid and severe when poor nutrition is a factor. Gum disease is a serious problem, since it can lead to tooth loss if untreated.<br><br><strong>Diet and Dental Health</strong><br>The American Dietetic Association and the National Institutes of Health recommend eating a well-balanced diet including plenty of fruits, vegetables, a good variety of breads and cereals, dairy products, fish, chicken, dried beans and peas, and meat. Enjoying a variety of foods is the best way to get all the important nutrients needed for keeping healthy. Beware of fad diets that exclude entire food groups. This can cause nutritional deficiencies.<br><br><strong>Snack Smart</strong><br>Snacking is a favorite pastime, but certain snack choices promote tooth decay such as soft, sweet, sticky foods.

Perhaps its sharp increase in popularity is the result of recent studies touting about all the wonderful things that come from removing all that “gunk,” including healthier teeth and gums and sweeter smelling breath.<br><br>Tongue scraping is an easy way to improve your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/a/83/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>. People with bad breath, particularly smokers or those with a taste for pungent food, will notice an improvement. Also, those who suffer from a fungal condition called “Brown Hairy Tongue” will benefit tremendously from a good tongue cleaning. For those with sweet smelling, fungus-free mouths, know that tongue scraping will reduce the bacteria that leads to <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stgumdisease.com/">gum disease</a> and tooth decay. In other words, just about anybody will be better off for the effort. So, how does it work?<br><br>A bit of research will tell you that there are dozens of tongue scraping appliances on the market today. One of the most popular and inexpensive types is a soft, flexible plastic strip that you bow and pull along your tongue. It’s an incredibly simple design with the potential for amazing results. Two or three strokes are usually sufficient. Please note, scraping should be done before brushing your teeth. It’s quick and easy; the most difficult part of the entire process is actually seeing what’s been in your mouth.<br><br>If you’re not interested in actually buying a tongue scraper, a toothbrush will work fairly well. Though they aren’t nearly as effective in removing debris and bacteria from your mouth as tools made for the job, it’s far better than doing nothing at all. If you’d like to learn more about tongue scraping, or would like help finding the right <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">dental hygiene</a> method for you, contact your dentist’s office, or mention it during your next check-up!</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Self-Care Toothbrush Tips for Special Needs</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Maintaining good oral hygiene can be a challenge, especially if you have developed a health condition that makes brushing and flossing more difficult, or have been in an accident that created new limitations. Dental professionals want to help all dental patients keep their mouths healthy, and they offer these suggestions about <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/a/96/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>.<br><br><strong>Dental Brushing Tips</strong><br>Problems in hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders can hinder a person’s ability to brush and floss. While each situation is different, there are some suggestions that have been effective in making <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dental care</a> easier:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Use a wide elastic band to attach the toothbrush to your hand for extra gripping power.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Attach a small rubber ball, a sponge, or a rubber grip to the toothbrush handle with strong tape. This enhances gripping power and is often useful when hand or arm movement is weakened or limited.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Use a longer wooden dowel, a ruler, or plastic rod to lengthen the toothbrush handle, wrapping it securely with strong tape. This longer length may help in more easily reaching your mouth.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Use an electric or sonic toothbrush.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Dental Flossing Tips</strong><br>If limitations make brushing and oral hygiene harder, flossing may be an even bigger challenge. Depending on your limitations, try these techniques:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Use a piece of floss, about 18″ long, and wind one end of floss around each finger instead of holding it. This will increase your grip and prevent the floss from dropping out of your fingers with each tooth you floss.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Hold the floss tightly and seesaw it back and forth between the teeth, instead of pushing the floss right through.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Tie the floss into a long circle instead of using one long piece, which may make it easier to hold and less likely to drop from your hands.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Try using a floss holder, available wherever <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">oral hygiene</a> products are sold.</span></li>

They are all made for at home use, ideally just before brushing. One popular and inexpensive model is a soft flexible plastic strip that you simply bend and pull over your tongue. Usually two or three strokes is enough to remove the “gunk.” The sight of the gunk on the tongue scraper is a little unpleasant, until you recall that it’s the same gunk that you would have left sitting on your tongue.<br><br><strong>Who Benefits from Tongue Scraping?</strong><br>Tongue scraping is acceptable and easy enough for anyone to do. People with halitosis (bad breath) will benefit greatly from tongue scraping. It also is very effective for smokers and people who enjoy pungent or strongly odored foods.

That 2 o’clock chair-side rendezvous may not seem nearly as exciting as a late lunch with a friend, but it will be well worth it in the end. Here are 10 really great reasons to stick with your regular <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/a/91/dental-cleaning">dental cleaning</a> schedule!<br><br>1. <strong>It Prevents Oral Cancer.</strong> You may or may not realize that you’re screened for oral cancer during your regular dental cleaning. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, an American dies of oral cancer every hour of every day. It’s a sad proposition, especially when you consider that it is highly curable with early diagnosis.<br><br><strong>2. It Wards Off Gum Disease.</strong> Gum disease, or an infection in the gum tissues and bone that keep your teeth in place, is one of the leading causes of adult tooth loss. It can be treated and reversed if diagnosed early. Unfortunately, not receiving treatment will lead to a more serious and advanced state of gum disease. Regular cleanings and check ups and daily brushing and flossing are key weapons in the fight against these conditions.<br><br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>It’s About More Than Your Mouth.</strong> Sure, not getting regular check-ups may make you less kissable, but did you know that studies have linked heart attacks and strokes to gum disease associated with poor oral hygiene? A trip to your dentist every 6 months could reduce your risk of serious health problems!<br><br><strong>4.</strong> <strong>You Want to Preserve Your Smile.</strong> As mentioned, gum disease is one of the leading causes of tooth loss in adults. To keep your pearly whites intact, stick with your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">teeth cleaning</a> schedule.<br><br><strong>5. It’s Best to Detect Dental Problems Early.</strong> We’ve already touched upon early detection of gum disease and oral cancer, but don’t overlook more basic dental problems. Cavities and broken fillings are easy to treat. Without regular trips to the dentist, these problems can lead to root canals, gum surgery and tooth extraction. Which sounds worse: A 30-minute cleaning or an hour under the knife?<br><br><strong>6. You Want to Know You’re Doing it Right.</strong> Maybe you bought a fancy new electric toothbrush, or aren’t keeping up with what current research has to say about caring for your teeth. Either way, check ups allow your dentist to examine your mouth and keep you on the right path.<br><br><strong>7. You Have Dental Insurance.</strong> Consider how much money you put into your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental insurance</a> plan. Take advantage of it and save a lot of money in the long run by avoiding costly procedures that result from poor dental habits.<br><br><strong>8. You Want to Upgrade Your Smile.</strong> If you’re already suffering from tooth decay or gum problems, regular appointments will allow our office to create a personalized treatment plan that will give you the best smile possible.<br><br><strong>9. You Want to Dazzle.</strong> Regular cleanings remove most tobacco, coffee and tea stains, polishing your teeth to a beautiful shine!<br><br><strong>10. You Need Some Time Alone.</strong> Okay, maybe not completely alone, but the time you spend in the waiting room and chair is really your time. You can forget about the office or the stresses of family life and just relax. Read a magazine or work through a crossword if you want. Take advantage of the time you’re given, rather than worrying about how to fit it in your tight schedule. Your health and well-being should never take a back seat to your daily planner.<br>If it’s been more than 6 months since your last check up and cleaning, call your dentist to schedule an appointment today!</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Xylitol: Chew Your Way To Healthier Teeth and Gums?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Are you crazy about gum, but not so much about its affect on your teeth? (Good for you!) Researchers presenting at the American Academy of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stpediatricdentist.com/">Pediatric Dentistry</a> Annual Session in Cincinnati found a natural sweetener may not only improve the taste of gum, juice and candy, it may also reduce tooth decay and increase <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalhygiene.com/">dental hygiene</a>.<br><br>Their study observed children of Belize over the course of several years, some of whom chewed gum with sugar, others with artificial sweeteners. Results showed that those who chewed gum artificially sweetened with Xylitol, a natural sweetener found in trees and fruit that does not cause cavities, suffered from less tooth decay over the duration of the study.<br>Another study done in Finland found fewer mothers transmitted cavity-causing bacteria to their children when they chewed gum with xylitol. The bacteria transmission occurs when mother and children share eating utensils.<br><br>Xylitol is widely available in most supermarkets, but know that it’s difficult to achieve the correct dosing. To see results, you’d have to chew gum with a high dose of Xylitol frequently and for prolonged durations.

When employers label children as dependents, however, they often see them as extensions of their parents. That means when it comes to awarding family dental benefits, you must be on the same policy. It’s important to be sure you select a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/385/dental-plan">dental plan</a> that works for both of you. Here are some things to consider when choosing your dental insurance carrier:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Your child has the right to see a pediatric dentist.</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stpediatricdentist.com/">Pediatric dentists</a> are specially trained to address the unique dental needs of young children, such as early preventive care and alleviating dental anxiety. If your family dental insurance plan only allows your child to see a pediatric dental specialist after an unsuccessful visit to a general dentist, consider making a change.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>What is the extent of your preventive care coverage?</strong> Children’s teeth are in a critical stage of development. Any potential problems should be identified and resolved as early as possible. It’s also crucial to establish positive dental care habits right from the start. This means dental exams early and often. If your dental plan puts unreasonable restrictions on a child’s early dental care, look for dental coverage elsewhere.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>What other procedures are covered? As mentioned, your child’s teeth are only just developing.</strong> If they do not grow properly, your child can experience pain or misshapen facial structure. Special care, such as orthodontics, is often required to correct the problem, and is often medically necessary. If your family dental insurance plan considers this specialized care to be cosmetic, and therefore not covered, look for something better.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>What is the extent of your emergency care coverage?</strong> Kids have accidents – it’s a fact of life. Not only are they generally more active than many adults, playing sports and climbing trees, but many have not yet developed refined coordination. That means plenty of falls or balls to the mouth. If your child loses a tooth or experiences some other sort of dental trauma, be sure your plan allows you to seek immediate emergency care without anybody’s permission.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m"><strong>It’s important for you to have a reasonable amount of control over your child’s dental care.</strong> If your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental insurance</a> company makes it difficult to choose or change dentists when you feel it’s necessary, or allows you very little say in whatever treatment is performed, shop around.</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">Insurance may seem like a costly investment, but a family dental plan that truly fits you and your children’s needs is well worth it. The preventive and emergency care you’ll receive will ensure all of you will enjoy good oral health for a lifetime.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Five Things You Should Know When Choosing A Dental Insurance Plan</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">You’ve heard time and again that dental insurance can protect you and your family from dental and financial catastrophe. Even cheap insurance with minimal coverage will most likely save you big bucks over the course of your lifetime. A quick Web search will show that insurance is big business, and your options are becoming more expansive – and complicated – by the day. Not sure where to begin? Here are five things to consider when selecting family dental plans or an individual <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental insurance</a> plan that works for you!<br><br><strong>Shop around!</strong> Finding a plan that works can be quite a feat. Even when employers offer dental insurance benefits to their employees and their families, it often isn’t enough. This means you’ll need to shop high and low until you find the best plan for your budget and lifestyle. The Internet has made all of this much easier – you have access to informational materials on a multitude of companies right at your finger tips. Be sure to read all the fine print; when it comes to your health, surprises are rarely a good thing.<br><br><strong>Know your limits.</strong> All insurance plans have maximums – some good, others bad. A low maximum on your total benefits is never a good thing. That means if something major (and expensive) comes up, you may have to delve into your own pockets. A second maximum applies to your yearly deductible, which is the most amount of money you’d be expected to pay for your own care. A low maximum on your deductible is a great thing, so be sure to do the math when comparing policies.<br><br><strong>Maintain control over your health.</strong> A <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/1011/dental-insurance-plans">dental insurance</a> company may or may not have your best interests at heart, but, either way, they’re somewhat removed from the situation. It’s important that you have a say in your dental health. For starters, shouldn’t you be able to choose your dentist, or at least have a plethora of options should one provider not work out? It’s also important that you and your dentist have a lot of pull when it comes to making important decisions – an insurance company should never put unreasonable restrictions on the type of care you can receive.<br><br><strong>Look for the 3 R’s (sort of): PRevention, Restoration and EmeRgency Care.</strong> Having access to these three types of dental care is critical for lifelong oral health. Preventive care reduces the likelihood that you’ll develop a dental condition that could have been avoided. Restorative care ensures that things that do go wrong, such as damaged or decayed teeth, will be fixed. Finally, emergency care you’ll receive the proper care when you need it immediately, such as if your tooth is knocked out. Some family dental plans cover other specialty care, like <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stbraces.com/">orthodontics</a>, so consider your needs and go from there.<br><br><strong>The waiting game.</strong> Some insurance companies make you wait a certain period of time before they will cover certain procedures. If you need immediate attention, find a policy that supports it. If everything’s in order, however, a minor wait may not be a major issue for you.<br><br>A carefully selected family or individual dental insurance plan could not only save you in a pinch, but ensure good oral health for life. It’s critical, however, to do your research and read the fine print. Don’t let your dental insurance company take you for a ride!</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Managed Dental Plans</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">“Managed” dental care is a great idea.<br><br>However, many <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">dentists</a> strongly feel that it should be “managed” by their patients, for their benefit – instead of by a dental insurance company for its benefit.<br><br>If you are covered by a dental insurance plan, and if your employer offers you a range of different programs, the time you spend investigating benefits will be time well spent. Doing so puts your family in control of the quality of dental care you can demand and receive from your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/104/dental-coverage">dental coverage</a>.<br><br>Words can have very different meanings, depending on an individual’s point of view. Some low cost dental insurance plans restrict patients to “preferred providers” of dental care. That sounds impressive until you recognize that providers are “preferred” by the insurer, not necessarily by you. And in many cases they’re preferred, frankly, because they agree to sell their services at a discounted rate.<br><br>Review your own insurance options carefully: some <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental plans</a> allow participants to continue receiving optimum care from their current physicians and dentists. Some don’t. It’s your choice.<br><br>The idea of solving dental health problems “at no (or minimal) cost to you” is understandably appealing. But recognize the tradeoff. Simply put, it’s “little cost and less choice.”</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>What is the best and most affordable family dental insurance plan for me?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Finding a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentist.com/">family dentist</a> and an affordable dental plan can be a confusing experience. Although there is no one “best” affordable dental plan, there are some plans that will be better than others for you and your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/105/family-dental-insurance">family dental insurance</a> needs. We will try to guide you in simple terms. However, rather than just giving you answers, the best thing we can do is to make sure you are equipped with the right questions.<br><br>There are three major things to consider, each with their own unique set of questions. By considering the questions thoroughly, you will arrive at the right and affordable dental plan for you and your family.</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">How affordable is the plan (cost of care)?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">How much will it cost me on a monthly basis?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Should I try to insure just major dental expenses or most of my dental expenses?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Can I afford a policy that at least covers my children?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are there deductibles I must pay before the family or individual dental insurance begins to help cover my costs?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">After I have met the deductible, what part of my costs are paid by the family dental insurance plan?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">If I use dentists outside a plan’s network, how much more will I pay to get care?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">How often do I visit the dentist and how much do I have to pay at each visit?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Does an affordable dental plan include services that match my needs (access of care)?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">What other dental providers are part of the individual or family dental insurance plan?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are there enough of the kinds of dentists I want to see?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Where will I go for care? Are these places near where I work or live?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Do I need to get permission before I see a dental specialist?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are there any limits to how much I must pay in case of a major illness?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Is the prescription medication which I need covered by the dental insurance plan?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Have people had good results when covered by a specific, affordable dental insurance plan (quality of care)?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">How do independent government organizations rate the different dental plans?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">What do my friends say about their experience with a specific plan?</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">What does my dentist say about their experience with a specific dental plan?</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">If you consider these elements carefully when choosing a <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">affordable dental insurance</a> plan, you can be assured the best possible outcome.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Types Of Discount Dental Plans – Coverage for Individuals and Families</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>DENTAL PPO PROGRAM</strong><br>A dental PPO – preferred provider organization – is a individual dental insurance plan that uses a network of contracted dentists to provide a better value. Like a medical PPO, the dentists on the dental PPO network have agreed to a discount dental plan set of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/103/dental-fees">dental fees</a> that have been established to be below the usual geographic area.<br><br>The dentists have agreed to the reduced fees in order to attract additional patients that might not have come to their office otherwise. The PPO network can replace some of the advertising that a dentist or dental group might rely on to bring in new patients. So you can see how medical and individual <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental insurance plans</a> are alike.<br><br><strong>DENTAL CAPITATION PROGRAM – DHMO</strong><br>A dental capitation or “Cap” program is another variation of discount dental coverage. They are sometimes referred to as Dental HMOs or DHMOs.  Unlike the traditional discount dental plans described above, a dental capitation insurance plan does not use the fee-for-service system, but pays the dentist a fixed amount for each patient each month.<br>The capitation refers to this fixed monthly payment, which is determined from a combination of the premium received and the historic utilization of that group. While a way to transfer some of the risk of the cost for extensive services to the dentist, it can also be a source of conflict when a number of patients need multiple services from the same provider.<br><br><strong>DENTAL REFERRAL or DISCOUNT DENTAL PLANS</strong><br>A dental referral plan is not insurance. This type of dental plan uses a network of contracted dentists, like a PPO or DHMO, but the benefit is simply a discounted fee on their individual dental insurance plan. Nothing is paid on behalf of the member; they are simply entitled to a lower fee for their dental care. While this can appear to be of limited value, some referral plans are able to save their members a significant amount of money in dental fees.<br><br>Be sure when you are purchasing a discount dental plan that you are aware of the nature of the plan. A dental referral plan may help you with special fees at a limited number of dental offices, but it does not provide emergency benefits when you are away from home unless you contact the plan office and find a participating dentist where you are visiting.<br><br><strong>GETTING THE MOST FROM YOUR DENTAL INSURANCE</strong><br>Dental insurance is focused on the preventive and diagnostic services for higher coverage. To get the maximum benefit from your insurance plan, you need to consider the following issues:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Is there an option that uses a PPO or DHMO network where you premium dollars will get more dental services? Often, using a PPO dentist can save you 10 – 20% from the usual fees.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Whether you are in a PPO or not, will your dentist provide a treatment plan for a large amount of work? To be sure that your dental services will be covered by your plan, it is best to have your dentist send in a pre-estimate of services. That way you will know that the services are covered and what your portion of the costs will be.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Can the treatment be set up in stages? If some care is more urgent than other services, perhaps your dentist can provide the services over two calendar years, thus utilizing two annual maximums. Annual maximums are usually $1500 or more, but that can be reached quickly with multiple services.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are there alternatives? Often, a dental problem can be solved in several different ways, all satisfactory and appropriate, but different. For instance, missing teeth can be replaced by <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalimplants.com/">dental implants</a>, or by a bridge (in most instances) or by a partial denture. All of these are acceptable dental care, but the costs can vary widely. Talk to your dentist about why he or she believes that this treatment is best for you and if you still have questions, seek a second opinion.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">How often can you get your teeth cleaned? Some plans indicate twice per year, while others limit you to once every 6 months.  If you have the second kind and your cleaning occurs before 6 months have passed, the insurance will not pay the benefit. Be aware of your plan coverage and the specifics before you get surprised</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are your children too old for coverage? Dental insurance for your family usually covers children as dependents up to age 18 or 19. If your child is over 18, you should understand when coverage ends and if they are a full-time student, what you must do to prove that for the insurance company.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Are the services that your dentist is proposing covered? Sometimes, new forms of dental treatment or cosmetic services are not covered by your dental insurance. Be sure to check your benefits guide and/or have your dentist submit a pre-treatment estimate to confirm that the services will be covered. If the services are denied, you or your dentist may need to write a letter and send more explanation regarding the need for these services.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Do you have coverage from both parents? The dental insurance companies will then use coordination of benefits to determine which insurance is primary and which is secondary for your children. Once you know that, the claim should be submitted to the primary carrier first.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Does your dentist give a discount for cash? Some offices will allow you to pay and receive a discount for cash and then send in the insurance yourself. This method could save you up to 10% at some offices.</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Does your dentist give a discount for referrals? If you send in your friends and neighbors, will the office give you a break on your bill? Ask what discounts might be available at your dental office to see how you might save more on your bill.</span></li>

</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">All of these plans have their pros and cons. Talk with the a dentist you trust to help you make the best choice to maximize your individual dental coverage need.<br>by Dr. Fred Sharpe</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Use ‘Em or Lose ‘Em: Take Advantage of Dental Coverage</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Yearly Maximums.</strong> Dental insurance plans put a maximum on the amount of money they’re willing to pay for your dental coverage. Maximums vary from one company or policy to the next, but typically fall around $1000. Sounds like a lot of money, doesn’t it? Insurance companies consider this amount to be a good investment. Allowing you to get regular dental care, your carrier can prevent the need for more serious (and more expensive) dental procedures down the road! Why not do you both a favor and use it, ensuring your mouth is in tip-top shape when next year rolls around?<br><br><strong>Premiums.</strong> Most people pay a monthly premium for their <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/383/dental-insurance-plans">dental insurance plans</a>. Even if you don’t need extensive treatment, you should use that money for regular check ups and cleanings to prevent them in the future. Don’t throw your money away!<br><br><strong>Deductibles.</strong> Insurance companies typically expect you to pay a certain amount of money for your dental care each year – usually about $500. If your smile isn’t in good shape, your dentist can create a treatment plan to put you back on track. Deductibles begin anew each year, so spreading out this care over more than 1 year will mean you have to pay more out-of-pocket. <strong>Inflation.</strong> It seems everything becomes more expensive from one year to the next, and dental materials and equipment are no exception. Putting off necessary dental care could mean that you’ll have to pay more down the road in <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalfinancing.com/">dental financing</a> costs.<br><br><strong>Dental  Problems Escalate.</strong> If your pearly whites are anything but, they’re only going to get worse. That is, of course, unless you take advantage of your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental coverage</a> and tend to your teeth and gums. A little cavity that isn’t bothering you one year may become a major headache (or toothache!) the next.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>What Is An Office Visit Co-payment, Dental Co-insurance And Plan Deductible</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">What is an office visit co-payment and co-insurance?<br>An office visit co-payment is a fixed dollar amount or a percentage that you pay for each <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/105/family-dental-insurance">Family Dental Insurance</a>dentist visit or for each dental service provided. For example, with some plans you may pay a fixed amount such as $5 or $10 per visit. Other plans will charge you a percentage of the total fee – or dental co-insurance — for the visit. So if your co-payment is 10% and the dentist visit was $200, you would pay 10% which, in this case, would be $20.<br>What is a dental insurance deductible?<br><br>A deductible is the amount of annual dental expenses that a dental plan member must pay before the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/a/382/dental-plan">dental insurance plan</a> will begin to cover expenses. For example, if your plan has a $50 deductible, you will pay the first $50 of your dental expenses before your <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201129193112/http://www.1stdentalinsurance.com/">dental plan</a>begins paying the expenses. Only expenses for covered services apply towards the deductible. For example, if you paid $1,000 for orthodontic work that was not an expense covered by the plan, then the $1,000 will not apply toward your annual deductible.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>What is Anxiety-Free Dentistry?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Wouldn’t it be wonderful to never dread the dentist again?

There are no needles involved; you simply take a small pill prior to your visit.<br><br>The great news is that whatever makes you uncomfortable about the dentist’s office—sights, sounds, or smells—you won’t notice them during your visit or be affected by them after you’re finished. And there’s no need to worry that the pill will wear off before Dr. Schneider is done; it provides up to six hours of complete comfort.<br><br>Even if you’ve been putting off dental visits for years, Dr. Schneider and the professional team at Steven Schneider, D.D.S can restore your mouth to good oral health in as little as one visit. Because you’re relaxed and at ease, it’s also easier for the numbing medication to take effect if a procedure is required. Comfort, relaxation, and a healthy mouth—all courtesy of anxiety-free dentistry at Steven Schneider, D.D.S in Poway, CA.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Who Can Benefit From Anxiety-free Dentistry?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">So many people in the Poway area can benefit from anxiety-free dentistry.<br><br>If you’re one of the many individuals who suffer from a phobia or a medical conditions that make a visit to the dentist nearly impossible to bear, this safe, modern alternative may be the right choice for you.<br>Anxiety-free dentistry is especially helpful for those with:</span><ul>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Intense fear</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Trauma from an early dental experience</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Difficulty getting numb</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">A sensitive gag reflex</span></li>

<li><span class="font-size-m">Complex dental problems</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">A limited timeframe in which to complete dental care</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m">Anxiety-free dentistry with Dr. Schneider also helps if the sights, sounds, and smells of a dental practice frighten you or if you hate needles.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Common Questions About Anxiety-free Dentistry</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Who should try anxiety-free dentistry?</strong><br>Everyone is different. Most people who avoid the dentist suffer from paralyzing fear. Maybe they’ve had a traumatic experience. Some put off going to the dentist because they simply don’t have the time. Others have a low pain tolerance or resistance to the numbing injections that most dentists use. Some dental patients can’t control a gag reflex, and still others are too embarrassed about the condition of their teeth.<br><br>No matter what your reason, there’s no need to feel embarrassed. Our team of professionals in Poway often sees patients who have not been to a dentist in years. It’s not unusual for us to see patients who require extensive, complex treatment. But the good news is that with anxiety-free dentistry, we can usually accomplish complete care and restoration in just one comfortable, relaxing visit.<br><br><strong>Will I be unconscious?</strong><br>There are varying degrees of anxiety-free medication available and after consultation, our team will help you will choose the one most appropriate for you. Anxiety-free dentistry is as simple as taking a pill and you’ll be conscious and responsive throughout the procedure. However, you’ll remain in a deeply relaxed state, so you won’t be nervous or fidgety. You’ll experience no discomfort or anxiety. You won’t be aware of sounds or smells around you, and you won’t remember any part of the treatment. When the procedure is complete, you’ll feel totally relaxed and you won’t remember a thing. In fact, it’ll seem like only a few minutes have passed.<br><br><strong>Is it safe?</strong><br>Throughout your visit our experienced clinical team will monitor your vital signs. You’ll receive compassionate, attentive care that will make you feel like you’re getting a spa treatment. The best part will come when you look in the mirror and see your healthy, happy smile.<br><br><strong>How long will it take?</strong><br>Depending on the condition of your teeth, your anxiety-free dentistry visit may last from two to six hours. Our highly-trained staff will focus only on you during your visit. There’ll be nothing to interrupt or interfere with your treatment, which is why we can usually treat even the most serious cases in just one visit.<br><br><strong>Do I need someone with me?</strong><br>Because you’ll need to take a pill before you leave home, someone must accompany you to and from the dentist’s office. Although you’ll feel completely refreshed when the procedure is over, you’ll still be under the effects of the anxiety-free medication.<br><br><strong>How do I get started?</strong><br>Don’t wait any longer. If it’s been a long time since you’ve seen a dentist, your teeth are probably deteriorating at an accelerated rate. You don’t want any more damage to occur than already has. Certainly there’s no need to suffer pain.<br><br>Our friendly staff is waiting to hear from you. Call Steven Schneider, D.D.S in Poway at (855) 464-0063. First, we need to gather some information regarding your health. Then we’ll discuss your specific needs and desires. Once you’ve talked with our caring professionals, you’ll wonder why you waited so long. The natural healthy smile you’ve been waiting for is just a dream away.<br><strong>Family Dentistry Services</strong><br><br>Family Dentistry Services</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>When should my child see Dr. Schneider for the first time?</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">At Steven Schneider, D.D.S in Poway, this is one of the most common questions we hear. While it’s really never too early, most children should have their initial appointment by around their first birthday.<br><br>A good rule of thumb is that when your baby’s first tooth appears, you should call to schedule an appointment. No, there’s not a lot of cleaning to be done yet, but the dental professionals at Steven Schneider, D.D.S can provide excellent advice about keeping your child’s teeth and gums healthy from the very beginning. Preventative care will protect your baby’s smile now and in the future.<br><br>For more information about your child’s dental care or to schedule an appointment with Dr. Schneider, call Steven Schneider, D.D.S today at 855-464-0063.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Sealants work to prevent dental decay in Poway area kids</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Regular brushing and flossing lowers your child’s chances of developing cavities. But kids aren’t known for their dedication to brushing and flossing, and that can lead to cavities. Fortunately, family dentist Dr. Steven Schneider in Poway, CA can help prevent cavities in your children’s teeth with the use of a sealant.<br><br>The grooves and depressions on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth are the most prone to decay, so it’s those surfaces that require further preventive care. At Steven Schneider, D.D.S, Dr. Schneider can apply a plastic-like coating called a “sealant” to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. The sealant is essentially painted onto the teeth, which means it’s quick, easy, and painless for your kids.<br><br>Studies have shown that sealants can reduce tooth decay by as much as 100 percent, so it’s no wonder that that the American Dental Association recommends sealants as soon as the first adult back teeth come in at age 6 or 7. Dr. Schneider will continue to apply a sealant as each back tooth comes in, up until about age 13, when most kids have gotten all of their adult molars.<br>For more information about the benefits of using a sealant to prevent tooth decay — or to make an appointment at Steven Schneider, D.D.S in Poway – call 855-464-0063 today.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Plaque, Gum Disease, and Tooth Loss</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Plaque strikes people in the Poway area at all stages of life: from the youngest child through the elderly population. And as a family dentist, Dr. Steven Schneider of Steven Schneider, D.D.S can help patients of all ages by removing the build-up of plaque that accumulates between dental visits.<br><br>You can help reduce the accumulation of plaque if you brush and floss regularly. When this soft, sticky layer of bacteria is allowed to build up, it can have serious consequences for your teeth. Dr. Schneider is dedicated to educating the Poway area about the danger of plaque build-up leading to gum disease.<br><br>Avoiding the dentist can allow dental problems such as this to compound, leading to tooth loss. A missing tooth is not only unattractive, but it can cause structural problems in your mouth.<br>Some patients assume that as long as they’re still able to eat without their missing tooth, that there’s no problem. Dr. Schneider helps patients understand that just one missing tooth can lead to other oral difficulties. The remaining teeth may begin to drift into the empty space, causing a change in way you bite or chew. It also forces the remaining teeth to carry an additional load, and you may begin to experience pain when you’re eating—or even when you aren’t.<br><br>Our goal at Steven Schneider, D.D.S is to help you enjoy the best oral health possible, whether that’s simply removing plaque during a regular dental appointment or more advanced solutions such as replacing one or more missing teeth. Count on Dr. Schneider to keep your teeth and gums healthy.<br><br>For more information or to make an appointment, call Steven Schneider, D.D.S in Poway today at 855-464-0063.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>Avoid a Dental Crisis With Regular Visits to Steven Schneider, D.D.S</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Fear keeps many people in the Poway area away from regular dental visits, but it’s not always the fear of pain—it’s also the fear of “wasting” time and money when they don’t believe there’s a problem. These patients believe in “crisis treatment” rather than “preventive treatment.” But which of those sounds less painful and expensive?<br><br>At Steven Schneider, D.D.S in San Diego, CA, our patients know that regular visits save them unnecessary pain, expense, and time. Filling a simple cavity is a quick, easy process—unlike the complex procedures required when cavities and tooth neglect turn into dental disease. Just because nothing hurts doesn’t mean that everything is okay with your teeth. Only regular exams with Dr. Steven Schneider can detect problems when they’re still small—or prevent them from occurring at all.<br><br>Most dental problems don’t have any symptoms until a problem reaches advanced stages, when they require a big commitment of time and money. A great example is tooth decay, which doesn’t cause pain until it’s advanced enough to get close to the nerve. At that point, a root canal and crown are usually necessary, instead of a small filling. But family dentist Dr. Schneider has the experience to detect a cavity three to four years before it develops symptoms. Now that’s preventive care!<br><br>To make an appointment for preventive care at Steven Schneider, D.D.S, call 855-464-0063 today.</span><br><br><span class="font-size-l"><strong>How Your Diet Effects Dental Health</strong></span><br><span class="font-size-m">Most people in the Poway area know that a proper diet throughout your lifetime is important in maintaining good health. But you may not know how much your diet affects your dental health as well. For example, a diet low in certain nutrients can reduce your resistance to oral infections, possibly contributing to periodontal disease (gum disease) and decay.<br><br>Dr. Schneider and his professional staff can help you understand the role your diet plays in maintaining good oral health and how your immune system can control periodontal disease. And the earlier you implement these tips, the healthier your teeth will be over your lifetime. Information from Dr. Schneider can help protect babies and young children from early decay, saving them trauma and you money.<br><br>A balanced diet and effective brushing and flossing can reduce or prevent the risk of many dental diseases.

Your dentures snap out, they snap in, they stay put<br><br><strong>How exactly does this system work?</strong><br>A certified dentist performs a procedure in which miniature posts are placed in your gums. These posts snap into small O –ring receptacles retro-fitted into your existing denture. This mini dental implant (MDI) system secures your dentures firmly in place while also allowing them to be snapped out and in again.<br><br><strong>What is the procedure like?</strong><br>The procedure is usually completed in a single appointment lasting just over an hour. You may have some discomfort for up to 48 hours, which is typically treated with ibuprofen or over the counter medications. Unlike more invasive options, this won’t require months of painful recovery.<br><br><strong>Will this system work for me?</strong><br>This is a revolutionary system ideal for many denture patients.

Only a certified dentist can confirm whether or not you are a candidate, but this system is a great option for patients:</span><ul>

<li><span class="font-size-m">Intimidated by the cost and long recovery time of full-size implants</span></li>
<li><span class="font-size-m">Without enough bone to allow for full-size implants</span></li>
</ul><br><span class="font-size-m"><strong>Is this a new system?</strong><br>No. The 3M Denture Attachment System, also known as the 3M Mini Dental Implant (MDI) System, was developed over ten years ago and thousands of people all over the county have experienced its lasting rewards.<br><br><strong>What about care and maintenance?</strong><br>Continue getting regular checkups with your dentist following the procedure. Over time your dentist may need to replace the O-rings in your dentures to help them work as well as they should. As with all dental implants, there is a risk the implant will not osseintegrate and there is the potential for fracture of the implant.<br><strong>Dental Implants</strong><br><br>Dental implants are a permanent solution to replacing natural teeth. The dental implant process requires several steps and a surgical procedure to place the titanium implant in your jawbone. Once healing occurs and the implant bonds with the jawbone, the prosthetic tooth is affixed.<br><strong>Invisalign/Clear Correct</strong><br><br>Invisalign is a straightening system for teeth that uses custom made aligners as a substitute for conventional, metal braces. The aligners are made from clear plastic and replaced every two weeks during treatment. Invisalign can help to correct many dental problems, including severe crowding, bite issues and tooth spacing.</span>
